```
        <source>New</source>
        <translation>新增 N</translation>
    
YES
The translation includes the character "N", which is likely unintended and not part of the correct translation for "New". "新增" alone means "Add" or "New" in Hong Kong Chinese and suffices for UI purposes. There are no format specifiers in the source, so none are required in the translation.

Correct translation:
新增
```

```
        <source>Copy</source>
        <translation>複製 C</translation>
    
YES
The translation "複製 C" is incorrect. The "C" is unnecessary and likely a typo. The correct translation is simply "複製".

Correct translation:
複製
```

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>關閉 l</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains an extraneous "l" at the end, which is erroneous and could confuse users.

Correct translation:
關閉
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>匯出 E</translation>
    
YES
The translation "匯出 E" is problematic. The English source is simply "Export". "匯出 E" includes an unnecessary "E" at the end, which could confuse users.

Correct translation:
匯出
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>刪除 D</translation>
    
YES
The translation "刪除 D" contains an erroneous extra "D" at the end, which is not present in the English source and is not appropriate in Cantonese (zh_HK). 

Correct translation:
刪除
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>選擇 h</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains an unwanted extraneous "h" character, which is not correct in the context and not present in the source text.

Correct translation:
選擇
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>複製地址 C</translation>
    
YES
The translation adds an unnecessary "C" at the end, which is not present in the source and is incorrect. It may cause confusion.

Correct translation:
複製地址
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>複製標記 L</translation>
    
YES
The translation includes an erroneous "L" at the end, which does not exist in the source text. "標記" is an appropriate translation for "Label". No extra whitespace issue is present.

Correct translation:
複製標記
```

```
        <source>Edit</source>
        <translation>編輯 E</translation>
    
YES
The translation includes an unnecessary "E" at the end, which is not required in Cantonese ('zh_HK'). The correct translation should simply be:

Correct translation:
編輯
```

```
        <source>Continue</source>
        <translation>继续</translation>
    
YES
The translation "继续" is in Simplified Chinese (zh_CN), not Traditional Chinese as used in Hong Kong (zh_HK). The correct Traditional Chinese translation should be:

繼續
```

```
        <source>An internal error occurred. %1 will attempt to continue safely. This is an unexpected bug which can be reported as described below.</source>
        <translation>發生了內部錯誤%1 將嘗試安全地繼續。 這是一個意外錯誤，可以按如下所述進行報告。</translation>
    
YES
There is a missing punctuation mark after "發生了內部錯誤". The English sentence separates the two clauses with a period, but the translation omits it, which can cause confusion. Also, there should be no extra space before "這是一個意外錯誤...".

Correct translation:
發生了內部錯誤。%1 將嘗試安全地繼續。這是一個意外錯誤，可以按如下所述進行報告。
```

```
        <source>Custom…</source>
        <translation>自定义...</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses simplified Chinese ("自定义...") instead of traditional Chinese as expected for 'zh_HK'. Also, the ellipsis character "…" in the source should be preserved in the translation for typographical accuracy.

Correct translation:
自訂…
```

```
        <source>Manual</source>
        <extracomment>Peer connection type established manually through one of several methods.</extracomment>
        <translation>手册</translation>
    
YES
The translation "手册" means "manual" as in a user guide or handbook, not "manual" as in "done by hand/manually" which is the intended meaning in this context (connection type established manually).

Correct translation:
手動
```

```
        <source>Feeler</source>
        <extracomment>Short-lived peer connection type that tests the aliveness of known addresses.</extracomment>
        <translation>触须</translation>
    
YES
The translation "触须" literally means "tentacle" or "antenna", which is not commonly used in Hong Kong Chinese for this network context. The correct translation in the context of Bitcoin (a connection that "feels/test probes" an address) should be more descriptive and locally accurate. In zh_HK, it would be clearer to use "探测连接" or "测试连接".

Correct translation:
探测连接
```

```
        <source>Overview</source>
        <translation>總覽 O</translation>
    
YES
The translation includes an extraneous "O" at the end that is not present in the source text, which is an error. The correct translation is:

Correct translation:
總覽
```

```
        <source>Transactions</source>
        <translation>交易 T</translation>
    
YES
The translation includes an unnecessary "T" character at the end, which is not present in the original source and may confuse users.

Correct translation:
交易
```

```
        <source>Exit</source>
        <translation>結束 x</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains an unnecessary "x" character, which is not present in the source and could confuse users. The word "結束" alone is accurate for "Exit" in zh_HK.

Correct translation:
結束
```

```
        <source>About %1</source>
        <translation>關於 %1 A</translation>
    
YES
The translation includes an unwanted stray "A" at the end, which is not present in the original English source. This is an error.

Correct translation:
關於 %1
```

```
        <source>About Qt</source>
        <translation>關於 Qt Q</translation>
    
YES
The translation incorrectly includes "Q" at the end, which does not belong. The correct translation should be:

關於 Qt
```

```
        <source>Send</source>
        <translation>付款 S</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. "付款" means "payment" or "to pay", which is acceptable, but the appended " S" at the end is unnecessary and incorrect. It may have been an accidental leftover.

Correct translation:
付款
```

```
        <source>Receive</source>
        <translation>收款 R</translation>
    
YES
The translation "收款 R" contains an unnecessary "R" at the end, which does not belong in the user-facing translation and is not present in the source text. 

Correct translation:
收款
```

```
        <source>Backup Wallet…</source>
        <translation>备份钱包(B)</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is in Simplified Chinese ("备份钱包"), not Traditional Chinese as used in Hong Kong ('zh_HK'). Furthermore, the "…", which is the ellipsis character, is omitted; and the accelerator key "(B)" is added, which is not present in the source.

Correct translation:  
備份錢包…
```

```
        <source>Change Passphrase…</source>
        <translation>修改密码(C)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "修改密码(C)" is problematic for 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Chinese). 

1. 'Passphrase' should be rendered as「密碼短語」or「密碼片語」in the context of Bitcoin and crypto applications, as it is distinct from a simple 'password'（密碼）. Translating it as '密码' could mislead users.
2. The '(C)' shortcut marking does not fit the native zh_HK Windows/Mac style—it is neither needed nor local.
3. The ellipsis ("…") is missing in the translation.
4. '修改' is accurate for "change", but see above about "Passphrase".

Correct translation:
更改密碼短語…

or

更改密碼片語…

Either can be accepted as the standard for zh_HK, but 密碼短語 is more widely used.
```

```
        <source>Load PSBT from file…</source>
        <translation>从文件加载PSBT(L)...</translation>
    
YES
There are two issues: 
1. The translation uses Simplified Chinese character "从" instead of the customary Traditional Chinese used in Hong Kong, which should be "從". 
2. The extra "(L)..." in the translation does not reflect the source and is unnecessary/unexplained.

Correct translation:
從檔案載入PSBT…
```

```
        <source>Open URI…</source>
        <translation>打开URI...</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses simplified Chinese ('打开'), which is 'zh_CN', not traditional Chinese as used in Hong Kong ('zh_HK'). Also, the ellipsis should match the source (which uses the Unicode ellipsis ‘…’ rather than three dots).

Correct translation:
開啟 URI…
```

```
        <source>Close Wallet…</source>
        <translation>关闭钱包...</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters and an ellipsis made of three periods (...), while the target should be in Traditional Chinese for 'zh_HK', and the ellipsis in Chinese is usually "…" (U+2026). Furthermore, "关闭" (close) is Simplified; in Hong Kong Traditional Chinese, "關閉" should be used.

Correct translation:
關閉錢包…
```

```
        <source>Create Wallet…</source>
        <translation>创建钱包...</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters "创建钱包...", which is typical for 'zh_CN', not 'zh_HK'. In Cantonese as used in Hong Kong, Traditional Chinese characters should be used. Also, the ellipsis should be the full-width ellipsis (…).

Correct translation:
建立錢包…
```

```
        <source>File</source>
        <translation>檔案 F</translation>
    
YES
The translation "檔案 F" incorrectly includes an extra "F", which is not present in the source and is not standard in Hong Kong Cantonese UI texts. It may have been an attempt to indicate a keyboard shortcut, but it is not correct in this context.

Correct translation:
檔案
```

```
        <source>Settings</source>
        <translation>設定 S</translation>
    
YES
The translation "設定 S" contains an unnecessary "S" at the end, which is not appropriate in Cantonese or traditional Chinese as used in Hong Kong. It should simply be "設定".

Correct translation:
設定
```

```
        <source>Help</source>
        <translation>說明 H</translation>
    
YES
The translation adds an inappropriate "H" character after the Chinese term for "Help" (說明). The "H" is not present in the source, could confuse users, and constitutes a format issue.

Correct translation:
說明
```

```
        <source>Connecting to peers…</source>
        <translation>连接到节点...</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Mainland Chinese characters and punctuation ("连接到节点..." with three periods), which is not appropriate for 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong). In zh_HK, it should use traditional Chinese characters and ideally an ellipsis (… or ……), and "节点" is usually rendered as "節點" in traditional Chinese.

Correct translation:
連接到節點…
or
正在連接到節點…
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses</source>
        <translation>付款地址(S)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "付款地址(S)" contains an incorrect format specifier rendering; the "(S)" is unnecessary and misleading. Also, in Cantonese/Hong Kong context, "付款地址" is fine but more natural phrasing would be "付款地址" or "發送地址". No spam or unwanted content.

Correct translation:
付款地址
```

```
        <source>Open a bitcoin: URI</source>
        <translation>打开bitcoin:开头的URI</translation>
    
YES
The translation is written in simplified Chinese and does not use Hong Kong (traditional) characters or locale. Also, it's a bit literal.

Correct translation:
打開以 bitcoin: 開頭的 URI
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>卸载钱包</translation>
    
YES
The translation "卸载钱包" means "Uninstall wallet," which is incorrect for "Close wallet." The correct translation for "Close wallet" in zh_HK should be "關閉錢包".

Correct translation:
關閉錢包
```

```
        <source>Migrate a wallet</source>
        <translation>迁移一个钱包</translation>
    
YES
The translation "迁移一个钱包" uses Simplified Chinese, while 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Chinese) typically uses Traditional Chinese. Also, the measure word "一个" is more common in Mainland usage; in Hong Kong, "一個" is standard, but can be omitted.

Correct translation:
遷移錢包
```

```
        <source>Hide</source>
        <translation>躲</translation>
    
YES
The translation "躲" means "to dodge" or "to hide (oneself physically)," which is not commonly used in user interfaces in Hong Kong Chinese. The term should be contextually appropriate for UI/UX, and the standard translation is "隱藏" for "Hide" in software menus or buttons.

Correct translation:
隱藏
```

```
        <source>Enable network activity</source>
        <extracomment>A context menu item. The network activity was disabled previously.</extracomment>
        <translation>關閉網路紀錄</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. The English "Enable network activity" means to turn network activity back on, but the translation "關閉網路紀錄" means "Disable network record" or "Close network log." This is the opposite action, and also the wording is inaccurate (紀錄 = log/record, not activity).

Correct translation:
啟用網絡活動
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>复制和数量</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate. "复制和数量" means "Copy and amount," which changes the meaning and adds an unwarranted conjunction. The correct translation should simply mean "Copy amount," that is, copying the numerical value.

Correct translation:  
複製金額
```

```
        <source>Lock unspent</source>
        <translation>锁定未花费(O)</translation>
    
YES
The translation adds an "(O)" at the end, which is not present in the source text, and is not standard for zh_HK locale translations or English UI context (may be mistaken as a shortcut key indicator, which is not implied in the source). The rest of the translation is accurate.

Correct translation:
鎖定未花費
```

```
        <source>Migrate wallet</source>
        <translation>迁移钱包</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses simplified Chinese characters ("迁移钱包"), which are standard for 'zh_CN', not 'zh_HK'. 'zh_HK' should use traditional Chinese characters and often prefers "移轉" or "遷移" for "migrate".

Correct translation:
遷移錢包
```

```
        <source>Migrating Wallet &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt;…</source>
        <translation>迁移钱包 &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt;...</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters ("迁移") instead of Traditional Chinese, which is standard for 'zh_HK'. "迁移" should be "遷移" in Traditional Chinese. Also, the ellipsis should use the proper Chinese punctuation "…" (U+2026), matching the source.

Correct translation:
遷移錢包 &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt;…
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>卸载钱包</translation>
    
YES
The translation "卸载钱包" means "Uninstall wallet," which is incorrect for "Close wallet." The correct translation for "Close wallet" in zh_HK should be "關閉錢包".

Correct translation:
關閉錢包
```

```
        <source>Closing the wallet for too long can result in having to resync the entire chain if pruning is enabled.</source>
        <translation>启用修剪时，如果一个钱包被卸载太久，就必须重新同步整条区块链才能再次加载它。</translation>
    
YES
The translation is in Simplified Chinese ('启用修剪时，如果一个钱包被卸载太久，就必须重新同步整条区块链才能再次加载它。') rather than in the zh_HK locale, which uses Traditional Chinese. The terminology should also be localized. 

Correct translation:
啟用修剪功能時，如果錢包長時間關閉，可能需要重新同步整條區塊鏈。
```

```
        <source>When you click OK, %1 will begin to download and process the full %4 block chain (%2 GB) starting with the earliest transactions in %3 when %4 initially launched.</source>
        <translation>當你點擊「確認」，%1會開始下載，並從%3年最早的交易，處裡整個%4區塊鏈(大小:%2GB)</translation>
    
YES  
There are issues with accuracy, punctuation, and completeness:
1. The phrase "starting with the earliest transactions in %3 when %4 initially launched" isn't fully and clearly conveyed.
2. The word "處裡" is a common typo; the correct form is "處理".
3. The punctuation and spacing are off: "區塊鏈(大小:%2GB)" should have a space after "區塊鏈" and parentheses should be full-width or match HK norms.
4. The phrase "並從%3年最早的交易" introduces ambiguity and doesn't specify that %3 is a time.
5. Missing full stop at the end.

Correct translation:
當你點擊「確認」，%1 會開始下載和處理整個 %4 區塊鏈（%2 GB），由 %4 最初推出時、%3 年的最早交易開始。

Explanation:
- The translation has been restructured for clarity and smoothness in Cantonese/HK written Chinese.
- All format specifiers (%1, %2, %3, %4) have been preserved and placed appropriately.
- Full-width brackets are used as per HK style, and space issues are fixed.
```

```
        <source>About %1</source>
        <translation>关于 %1</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese ("关于") rather than Traditional Chinese as used in Hong Kong ('zh_HK'). In Hong Kong, "關於" is standard.

Correct translation:
關於 %1
```

```
        <source>Network</source>
        <translation>网络(N)</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses "网络", which is simplified Chinese. For 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Chinese), the traditional form "網絡" should be used.

Correct translation:
網絡(N)
```

```
        <source>This allows you or a third party tool to communicate with the node through command-line and JSON-RPC commands.</source>
        <extracomment>Tooltip text for Options window setting that enables the RPC server.</extracomment>
        <translation>这允许作为用户的你或第三方工具通过命令行和JSON-RPC命令行与节点通信。</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese ("这允许作为用户的你或第三方工具通过命令行和JSON-RPC命令行与节点通信。"), but 'zh_HK' should use Traditional Chinese characters. Additionally, "JSON-RPC命令行" is awkward; it should be "JSON-RPC 命令" (with a space) and "你作為用戶" would be a better phrasing in Traditional Chinese.

Correct translation:
這允許你或第三方工具通過命令列和 JSON-RPC 命令與節點通訊。
```

```
        <source>Spend unconfirmed change</source>
        <translation>动用尚未确认的找零资金(S)</translation>
    
YES
The translation is understandable but not accurate to Hong Kong Chinese (zh_HK) conventions. The use of “资金(S)” is not typical in Hong Kong, and the addition of “(S)” is unexplained and unnecessary. Also, "找零" is commonly used in Mainland Chinese, while Hong Kong Cantonese would prefer “找續”. 

Correct translation:
動用未確認的找續
```

```
        <source>Allow incoming connections</source>
        <translation>允许传入连接(G)</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses simplified Chinese characters ("允许") rather than traditional characters appropriate for 'zh_HK', and it also unnecessarily includes "(G)", which is not present in the source and could be confusing.

Correct translation:
允許傳入連線
```

```
        <source>Connect through SOCKS5 proxy (default proxy):</source>
        <translation>通过 SOCKS5 代理连接(默认代理):</translation>
    
YES
The translation is in Simplified Chinese ("通过 SOCKS5 代理连接(默认代理):") instead of Hong Kong Cantonese written in Traditional Chinese, which is the standard for 'zh_HK'. The parentheses used are also Western instead of the full-width punctuation typically used in Traditional Chinese texts.

Correct translation:
透過 SOCKS5 代理連線（預設代理）:
```

```
        <source>Continue</source>
        <translation>继续</translation>
    
YES
The translation "继续" is in Simplified Chinese (zh_CN), not Traditional Chinese as used in Hong Kong (zh_HK). The correct Traditional Chinese translation should be:

繼續
```

```
        <source>Your current balance in watch-only addresses</source>
        <translation>您当前在仅观察观察地址中的余额</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains a redundancy ("仅观察观察地址" — "watch-only watch addresses") and uses "当前" (Mainland Chinese) instead of the more Hong Kong-appropriate "現時". The translation is also awkward and not fully localized.

Correct translation:
您現時在僅供觀察地址中的結餘
```

```
        <source>Mined balance in watch-only addresses that has not yet matured</source>
        <translation>仅观察地址中尚未成熟的挖矿收入余额:</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese ("仅观察地址中尚未成熟的挖矿收入余额:") instead of using the expected Hong Kong Traditional Chinese. Also, stylistically, the colon at the end is not present in the source.

Correct translation:
僅供觀察地址中尚未成熟的挖礦收入餘額
```

```
        <source>Current total balance in watch-only addresses</source>
        <translation>仅观察地址中的当前总余额</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese and a Mainland phrasing ("仅观察地址中的当前总余额") instead of Hong Kong Traditional style ('zh_HK'). It lacks proper localization and does not use traditional characters.

Correct translation:
僅供觀察地址中的當前總餘額
```

```
        <source>Save…</source>
        <translation>拯救...</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect and problematic. "拯救" means "to rescue" or "to save (a life)" in Chinese, which is not appropriate for the context of a software menu "Save…" action. The correct term should be "儲存…", which is commonly used in Hong Kong Cantonese software for "Save…".

Correct translation:
儲存…
```

```
        <source>Copy Image</source>
        <translation>复制图像(C)</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters ("复制图像") instead of Traditional Chinese, which is standard in 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong). Also, '复制' is not commonly used in Hong Kong; '複製' (Traditional) is preferred. The shortcut key "(C)" is often omitted in Cantonese UI, but if included, it should correspond to the local language.

Correct translation:
複製圖片

or, if keeping the shortcut key:
複製圖片(C)
```

```
        <source>Information</source>
        <translation>資訊 I</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. The addition of " I" after "資訊" is erroneous and does not belong in the translation.

Correct translation:
資訊
```

```
        <source>Memory Pool</source>
        <translation>内存池</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters ("内存池") instead of Traditional Chinese as standard in Hong Kong ('zh_HK'). 

Correct translation:
記憶池
```

```
        <source>(none)</source>
        <translation>(无)</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese '(无)' instead of the Traditional Chinese '(無)' appropriate for 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Chinese). 

Correct translation:
(無)
```

```
        <source>Hide Peers Detail</source>
        <translation>隐藏其他人的详细信息</translation>
    
YES
The translation is using simplified Chinese ("隐藏") instead of the Cantonese (Hong Kong) standard, which should use traditional Chinese characters. Also, "Peers" here refers to "nodes" or "peers" in a network context, not "other people". The translation "其他人的详细信息" is inaccurate; it means "the detailed info of other people".

Correct translation:
隱藏同儕詳情
```

```
        <source>Decrease font size</source>
        <translation>缩小字体大小</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese ("缩小字体大小") instead of Traditional Chinese, which is preferred for 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong). 

Correct translation:
縮小字體大小
```

```
        <source>Open</source>
        <translation>打开(O)</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese ('打开') and the Mainland China style for shortcuts ('(O)'), which is not appropriate for 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Cantonese/Traditional Chinese). It should be in Traditional Chinese and, if a shortcut is included, follow Hong Kong conventions.

Correct translation:
開啟
```

```
        <source>Outbound Address Fetch: short-lived, for soliciting addresses</source>
        <extracomment>Explanatory text for a short-lived outbound peer connection that is used to request addresses from a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Outbound 地址取得: 用於短暫，暫時 測試地址</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "用於短暫，暫時 測試地址" means "used for a short time, temporary test address," which doesn't accurately convey "for soliciting addresses" (i.e., for requesting addresses). Also, there is an unnecessary space before "測試地址", and "Outbound" should be translated properly into Chinese.

Correct translation:
Outbound 地址擷取：短暫使用，用於向對方請求地址
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <extracomment>Context menu action to copy the address of a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>复制地址(C)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "复制地址(C)" uses Simplified Chinese ("复制") instead of the Traditional Chinese character preferred in Hong Kong ("複製"). Also, for Hong Kong standards and convention, the shortcut "(C)" is generally not used unless it matches the actual interface.

Correct translation:
複製地址
```

```
        <source>1 hour</source>
        <translation>1 小时(H)</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese "小时" instead of Traditional Chinese "小時" which is standard for 'zh_HK'. Also, "(H)" is unnecessary or confusing in the context, unless the English source includes it.

Correct translation:
1 小時
```

        <translation>欢迎来到 %1 RPC 控制台。
使用上与下箭头以进行历史导航，%2 以清除屏幕。
使用%3 和 %4 以增加或减小字体大小。

%7 警告：骗子们很活跃，告诉用户在这里输入命令，偷走他们钱包中的内容。不要在不完全了解一个命令的后果的情况下使用此控制台。%8</translation>
    
YES
The translation is mostly accurate, but there is a minor issue with the placement of spaces in format specifiers, particularly for "%3 和 %4", where there is a missing space before "%3", which creates inconsistency. Additionally, '%7警告' should not have a space after '%7' to mimic the original formatting, where '%7WARNING:' has no space between '%7' and 'WARNING'. Also, the tone and style are otherwise appropriate.

Correct translation:
歡迎來到 %1 RPC 控制台。
使用上與下箭頭以進行歷史導航，%2 以清除屏幕。
使用 %3 和 %4 以增加或減小字體大小。
輸入 %5 以顯示可用命令的概覽。
查看更多關於此控制台的信息，輸入 %6。

%7警告：騙子活動頻繁，會指示用戶在此輸入指令，竊取他們的錢包資產。未完全了解指令後果前，切勿在此控制台操作。%8

主要修正如下：
- 「%3 和 %4」前後空格統一。
- 「%7警告」去除多餘空格，以符合原文格式。
- 用詞稍作地區化（例如「輸入指令」和「錢包資產」會更貼近港澳地區用法）。

如果需要繁體中文香港用語風格，可以根據具體情境微調詞彙。

        <source>Copy message</source>
        <translation>复制消息(M)</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Mainland Chinese "复制消息(M)" instead of the appropriate Hong Kong Cantonese form and uses "消息" for "message", which is less natural in the context of software/UI translation in Hong Kong. Also, the hotkey "(M)" may not match the correct Chinese character.

A more suitable 'zh_HK' translation would be:
複製訊息

If a keyboard shortcut is needed, it should be presented as:
複製訊息(&M)
 
So, the correct translation is:
複製訊息(&M)
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>复制和数量</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate. "复制和数量" means "Copy and amount," which changes the meaning and adds an unwarranted conjunction. The correct translation should simply mean "Copy amount," that is, copying the numerical value.

Correct translation:  
複製金額
```

```
        <source>Custom change address</source>
        <translation>自定义找零地址</translation>
    
YES
The translation "自定义找零地址" is in simplified Chinese ('zh_CN'), not in traditional Chinese as needed for 'zh_HK'. While the meaning is clear and correct, the characters should be adapted to traditional Chinese for Hong Kong.

Correct translation:
自訂找贖地址
```

```
        <source>Choose…</source>
        <translation>选择...</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses simplified Chinese characters ("选择..."), while 'zh_HK' should use traditional Chinese characters consistent with the Hong Kong locale. The ellipsis character is also different (should use "…").

Correct translation:
選擇…
```

```
        <source>Enable Replace-By-Fee</source>
        <translation>启用手续费追加</translation>
    
YES
The provided translation uses simplified Chinese ("启用") rather than traditional Chinese as customary in 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong). Additionally, "手续费追加" does not clearly express "Replace-By-Fee” (RBF). A more accurate 'zh_HK' translation matching the context would be:

啟用可替代手續費 (RBF)
```

```
        <source>Send</source>
        <translation>发送(E)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "发送(E)" is not localized for 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Chinese). In Hong Kong, the term "發送" is traditionally used instead of the simplified "发送" (which is mainland usage). Additionally, the "(E)" is problematic—in Hong Kong software, accelerator keys are rarely denoted this way, and if present, they should correspond to the menu shortcut key, but "E" does not match "Send" in this context.

Correct translation:
發送
```

```
        <source>Sign on device</source>
        <extracomment>"device" usually means a hardware wallet.</extracomment>
        <translation>在設備上簽證</translation>
    
YES
The word "簽證" in Chinese means "visa," which is not appropriate in this context. For digital signing, the correct term is "簽名". Also, the phrase is generally correctly translated as "在設備上簽名".

Correct translation:
在設備上簽名
```

```
        <source>Create Unsigned</source>
        <translation>创建未签名交易(E)</translation>
    
YES
The translation is mostly accurate but includes "(E)" at the end, which is not present in the original source text. "(E)" typically denotes a keyboard shortcut in some UI contexts, but since it's not in the source, it should not be present in the translation unless the UI requires it for localization consistency.

Correct translation:
創建未簽名交易
```

```
        <source>Please, review your transaction proposal. This will produce a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) which you can save or copy and then sign with e.g. an offline %1 wallet, or a PSBT-compatible hardware wallet.</source>
        <extracomment>Text to inform a user attempting to create a transaction of their current options. At this stage, a user can only create a PSBT. This string is displayed when private keys are disabled and an external signer is not available.</extracomment>
        <translation>請檢查您的交易提案。這將產生部分簽名的比特幣交易（PSBT），您可以儲存或複製該交易，然後使用簽名。離線%1錢包或與PSBT相容的硬體錢包。</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The sentence structure is awkward and the clause "然後使用簽名。離線%1錢包或與PSBT相容的硬體錢包。" introduces a period in the middle of a phrase, which damages clarity. The translation is also missing the connective sense that you can sign with (for example) an offline %1 wallet or a PSBT-compatible hardware wallet.

Correct translation:
請檢查您的交易提案。這將產生部分簽名的比特幣交易（PSBT），您可以儲存或複製，然後使用例如離線的 %1 錢包或支援 PSBT 的硬件錢包進行簽名。
```

```
        <source>Confirm send coins</source>
        <translation>确认发币</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese ("确认发币") instead of Hong Kong Cantonese/traditional Chinese with localized phrasing. In a Hong Kong context, "确认發送比特幣" or "確認發送貨幣" would be more appropriate. Also, the term "發幣" is not commonly used in formal Hong Kong interfaces; "發送" (send) is better.

Correct translation:
確認發送比特幣
```

```
        <source>The Bitcoin address to send the payment to</source>
        <translation>將支付發送到的比特幣地址給</translation>
    
YES
The translation has incorrect word order and an extra character "給" at the end, which is unnecessary and ungrammatical in this context. It should be:

Correct translation:
用來接收付款的比特幣地址

or more literally:
接收付款的比特幣地址
```

```
        <source>Subtract fee from amount</source>
        <translation>從付款金額減去手續費(U)</translation>
    
YES  
The translation adds "(U)" at the end, which is not present in the source and could be confusing or regarded as unwanted content. Additionally, the translation could be more concise and faithful to the original.

Correct translation:  
從金額中扣除手續費
```

```
        <source>Send</source>
        <translation>发送</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses the simplified Chinese character "发送", which is appropriate for 'zh_CN' (Mainland China), but 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong) generally uses traditional characters. The correct traditional Chinese translation should be "發送".

Correct translation:
發送
```

```
        <source>Verify Message</source>
        <translation>验证消息签名(M)</translation>
    
YES
The translation is in Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) wording and style, not in Traditional Chinese as used in 'zh_HK'. Also, the term "消息签名" means "message signature" rather than just "message". Additionally, the original text does not have the accelerator "(M)".

Correct translation:
驗證訊息

If indicating the hotkey (M) is required based on context/UI guideline, it should be:
驗證訊息(M)
```

```
        <source>Sent to</source>
        <translation>发送到</translation>
    
YES
The translation "发送到" is in Simplified Chinese ('zh_CN'), not Traditional Chinese as required for 'zh_HK'. In 'zh_HK', the translation should use Traditional Chinese characters and local phrasing.

Correct translation:
發送至
```

```
        <source>Sent to</source>
        <translation>发送到</translation>
    
YES
The translation "发送到" is in Simplified Chinese ('zh_CN'), not Traditional Chinese as required for 'zh_HK'. In 'zh_HK', the translation should use Traditional Chinese characters and local phrasing.

Correct translation:
發送至
```

```
        <source>Range…</source>
        <translation>范围...</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese ("范围") rather than Traditional Chinese as used in 'zh_HK'. Also, the ellipsis character "…" in the source is replaced with three periods "...", which is inconsistent with the source format.

Correct translation:
範圍…
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>复制和数量</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate. "复制和数量" means "Copy and amount," which changes the meaning and adds an unwarranted conjunction. The correct translation should simply mean "Copy amount," that is, copying the numerical value.

Correct translation:  
複製金額
```

```
        <source>Increase transaction fee</source>
        <translation>增加矿工费(F)</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "Increase transaction fee" as "增加矿工费(F)" is problematic for two reasons:
1. "矿工费" is more commonly used in Mainland China. In Hong Kong Cantonese ('zh_HK'), "手續費" (handling fee/transaction fee) is the standard expression.
2. The addition of "(F)" is unexplained and not present in the source; it introduces a stray format problem unless it has contextual meaning (like a shortcut indicator), which isn't specified here.

Correct translation:
增加交易手續費
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>匯出 E</translation>
    
YES
The translation "匯出 E" is problematic. The English source is simply "Export". "匯出 E" includes an unnecessary "E" at the end, which could confuse users.

Correct translation:
匯出
```

```
        <source>Error: Dumpfile identifier record is incorrect. Got "%s", expected "%s".</source>
        <translation>
錯誤：轉存檔案識別記錄不正確。獲得%s，預期
%s。</translation>
    
YES
There is an unnecessary line break before "%s" in the translated text, causing a formatting issue. Also, "獲得" is less natural than "收到" or "獲得了". For clarity and conformity with the original structure, the sentence should not break across lines, and the wording can be slightly refined.

Correct translation:
錯誤：轉存檔案識別記錄不正確。收到「%s」，預期「%s」。
```

```
        <source>More than one onion bind address is provided. Using %s for the automatically created Tor onion service.</source>
        <translation>提供多數TOR路由綁定位址。 對自動建立的Tor服務用%s</translation>
    
YES
1. The Chinese translation uses "多數TOR路由綁定位址", but "onion bind address" should be accurately rendered as "onion 綁定地址" or "onion 綁定位址", not "TOR路由綁定位址".
2. There is a missing space between sentences: "位址。 對自動建立的..." should remove the space after "。".
3. The translation omits "onion service", only saying "Tor服務", which is insufficiently specific.
4. "提供多數" translates to "provide multiple", but "More than one" is better translated as "超過一個".

Correct translation:
提供超過一個 onion 綁定位址。將使用 %s 作為自動建立的 Tor onion 服務。
```

```
        <source>%s is set very high! Fees this large could be paid on a single transaction.</source>
        <translation>%s被设置得很高! 这可是一次交易就有可能付出的手续费。</translation>
    
YES
The translation is understandable but has minor stylistic and punctuation issues inconsistent with 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Cantonese) conventions. The exclamation mark should have a space before it according to CJK standards, and the tone is a bit off for HK Cantonese—should be more colloquial. Also, contextually, "这可是一次交易就有可能付出的手续费。" is awkward and doesn't accurately capture the warning tone or the information conveyed in the original.

Correct translation:
%s 設定得非常高！呢個咁大嘅手續費一單交易都可能要畀晒。
```

```
        <source>Error: Duplicate descriptors created during migration. Your wallet may be corrupted.</source>
        <translation>错误：迁移过程中创建了重复的输出描述符。你的钱包可能已损坏。</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses simplified Chinese ("错误", "迁移", "创建", "描述符", "你的", "已损坏") instead of the expected traditional Chinese appropriate for 'zh_HK'. For Hong Kong ('zh_HK'), the translation should use traditional Chinese characters and local wording.

Correct translation:
錯誤：在遷移過程中建立了重複的描述符。你的錢包可能已損壞。
```

```
        <source>Disk space is too low!</source>
        <translation>磁盘空间太低!</translation>
    
YES
There are two issues:
1. The correct term in Hong Kong Cantonese should be "磁碟空間不足！" instead of "磁盘空间太低!", as "磁盘" and "空间太低" are more typical of Mainland Chinese usage ("磁碟" is used in Cantonese/HK, and "空間不足" is the idiomatic expression for "space is too low"/"insufficient space").
2. The exclamation mark should be a full-width Chinese exclamation mark: ！

Correct translation:
磁碟空間不足！
```

```
        <source>Error: Couldn't create cursor into database</source>
        <translation>错误: 无法在数据库中创建指针</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese ("错误: 无法在数据库中创建指针") instead of Traditional Chinese as is standard for 'zh_HK'. Additionally, "指针" should more properly be translated as "游標" (cursor) in database contexts for Chinese.

Correct translation:
錯誤：無法在資料庫中建立游標
```

```
        <source>Error: Dumpfile checksum does not match. Computed %s, expected %s</source>
        <translation>錯誤：轉存檔案的校驗和不匹配。%s計算得%s</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incomplete and does not convey the "expected %s" part from the source. The sentence is also awkward due to word order.

Correct translation:
錯誤：轉存檔案的校驗和不匹配。計算得 %s，應為 %s
```

```
        <source>Error: Unable to parse version %u as a uint32_t</source>
        <translation>错误：无法把版本号%u作为unit32_t解析</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains a typo: "unit32_t" should be "uint32_t". Also, in 'zh_HK', it's better to use traditional Chinese and Cantonese writing style.

Correct translation:
錯誤：無法將版本號 %u 解析為 uint32_t
```

```
        <source>Error: Unable to write data to disk for wallet %s</source>
        <translation>错误：无法将数据写入钱包的磁盘%s。</translation>
    
YES
The translation is understandable but the word order is unnatural in Chinese (Hong Kong), and the placement of "%s" is awkward. The standard wording would place "%s" immediately after "钱包". Also, the term "错误" is simplified Chinese; in Hong Kong (zh_HK), the traditional form "錯誤" is used.

Correct translation:
錯誤：無法將資料寫入錢包 %s 的磁碟。
```

```
        <source>Failure removing transaction: %s</source>
        <translation>%s删除交易时失败: </translation>
    
YES
The translation does not follow the correct word order and format specifier placement. The colon appears at the end rather than after the failure message. Also, there is a missing space after the format specifier, and the word order is unnatural in Chinese.

Correct translation:
移除交易時失敗：%s
```

```
        <source>Fee rate (%s) is lower than the minimum fee rate setting (%s)</source>
        <translation>手续费率 (%s) 低于最大手续费率设置 (%s)</translation>
    
YES
The translation has an error: "低于最大手续费率设置" means "lower than the maximum fee rate setting", but the source says "lower than the minimum fee rate setting". The word "最大" (maximum) should be "最低" (minimum).

Correct translation:
手续费率 (%s) 低于最低手续费率设置 (%s)
```

```
        <source>Not found pre-selected input %s</source>
        <translation>找不到预先选择输入%s</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses "预先选择输入" which is Simplified Chinese, not Traditional Chinese as appropriate for 'zh_HK'. In Cantonese or Hong Kong Traditional Chinese, it should be:

找不到預先選取的輸入 %s

Correct translation:
找不到預先選取的輸入 %s
```

```
        <source>Pruning blockstore…</source>
        <translation>修剪区块存储...</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses simplified Chinese characters ("修剪区块存储..."), which are not standard for 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Chinese, which prefers traditional Chinese characters). The ellipsis should also match typographically (…).

Correct translation:
修剪區塊存儲…
```

```
        <source>Transaction amounts must not be negative</source>
        <translation>交易金额不不可为负数</translation>
    
YES
There is a redundancy in the phrase "不不可为负数" ("not not allowed to be negative"). The correct expression should be "交易金額不可為負數" in Traditional Chinese used in Hong Kong ('zh_HK').

Correct translation:
交易金額不可為負數
```

```
        <source>Transaction change output index out of range</source>
        <translation>交易尋找零輸出項超出範圍</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. The English "Transaction change output index out of range" means that the index of the change output in the transaction is outside the allowable range. However, "交易尋找零輸出項超出範圍" awkwardly translates to "Transaction seeks zero output item out of range", which is incorrect and confusing in the context of Bitcoin.

Correct translation:
交易找零輸出索引超出範圍
```

```
        <source>Wallet file creation failed: %s</source>
        <translation>钱包文件创建失败：1%s</translation>
    
YES
The translation has an error: "1%s" is incorrect and introduces an unwanted '1' before the format specifier, which is not in the original string. The proper format specifier should be carried over as "%s".

Correct translation:
錢包文件建立失敗：%s
```
