```
        <source>New</source>
        <translation>新增 N</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it contains an unnecessary character "N" after "新增". The correct translation should be "新增".
NO
```

```
        <source>Copy</source>
        <translation>複製 C</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains an extraneous character 'C' at the end of the word '複製'. The correct translation should be '複製'.
NO
```

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>關閉 l</translation>
    
YES: The translation includes an extraneous character 'l' at the end of the word "關閉".
Correct translation: 關閉
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>匯出 E</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic because it incorrectly appends an "E" to the translated word. This could be a typo or an artifact from the translation process. The "E" should be removed for a correct translation.
匯出
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>刪除 D</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic as it includes an extraneous "D" at the end of the word "刪除" which means "Delete". This could be an accidental character or a placeholder.
The correct translation should be: 刪除
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>選擇要付錢過去的地址</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. It should be "Choose the address to send coins to". The current translation means "Choose the address to pay money to".

Correct translation: 選擇要發送加密貨幣到該地址
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>選擇 h</translation>
    
YES: The translation includes an extraneous character "h" at the end of the word "選擇".
Correct translation: 選擇
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>複製地址 C</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The character "C" at the end of the translation is extraneous and does not appear in the source text. It might be a leftover from a previous or incorrect translation.
Correct translation: 複製地址
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>複製標記 L</translation>
    
YES - The character 'L' at the end of the translation is extraneous and likely a typo. It should be removed.
Correct translation: 複製標記
```

```
        <source>Edit</source>
        <translation>編輯 E</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic as it contains an extraneous "E" after "編輯". This is likely a mistranslation or an artifact from the translation process.

Correct translation:
編輯
```

```
        <source>Continue</source>
        <translation>继续</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. "Continue" in the context of Bitcoin should be translated to 繼續 (gaai juk).
NO
```

```
        <source>Remember that encrypting your wallet cannot fully protect your bitcoins from being stolen by malware infecting your computer.</source>
        <translation>請記得將錢包加密不能完全防止你的 Bitcoins 經被入侵電腦的惡意程式偷取。</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses "經被" which is not standard and awkward. The phrase should be "由於" or "透過" to indicate the means by which the theft occurs.

Correct translation: 請記得將錢包加密不能完全防止你的 Bitcoins 由於被入侵電腦的惡意程式偷取。
```

```
        <source>An internal error occurred. %1 will attempt to continue safely. This is an unexpected bug which can be reported as described below.</source>
        <translation>發生了內部錯誤%1 將嘗試安全地繼續。 這是一個意外錯誤，可以按如下所述進行報告。</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic due to incorrect placement of the format specifier '%1'. It should be placed after the phrase it modifies, not directly attached to the preceding word. Additionally, there's an unnecessary space before the format specifier.

Correct translation:
發生了內部錯誤，%1 將嘗試安全地繼續。這是一個意外錯誤，可以按如下所述進行報告。
```

```
        <source>Custom…</source>
        <translation>自定义...</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses simplified Chinese characters instead of traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong.
Custom… -> 其他…
```

```
        <source>Manual</source>
        <extracomment>Peer connection type established manually through one of several methods.</extracomment>
        <translation>手册</translation>
    
YES
The translation "手册" (shǒu cè) is the Chinese word for "manual" in a general sense. However, in the context of Bitcoin and peer connection types, "手動" (shǒu dòng) is the more appropriate and commonly used term to indicate something done by hand or manually.

Correct translation: 手動
```

```
        <source>Feeler</source>
        <extracomment>Short-lived peer connection type that tests the aliveness of known addresses.</extracomment>
        <translation>触须</translation>
    
YES - The translation "触须" (zh_HK: chuk6 syu1) means "tentacle" or "feelers" (of an insect). While it can be interpreted as testing or probing, it's not the most common or accurate term for a Bitcoin network concept. A more appropriate term would be something like "探测" (cit3 tong3) or "试探" (si3 tam3) which mean "probe" or "test". The context of "aliveness of known addresses" strongly suggests a probing/testing function.

NO
```

```
        <source>Overview</source>
        <translation>總覽 O</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains extraneous content ("O").
總覽
```

```
        <source>Transactions</source>
        <translation>交易 T</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The character "T" after "交易" is an unwanted artifact.
Correct translation: 交易
```

```
        <source>Exit</source>
        <translation>結束 x</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains an extraneous character 'x' which is not present in the source text.
Correct translation: 結束
```

```
        <source>About %1</source>
        <translation>關於 %1 A</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and contains extraneous content. The character "A" at the end of the translation is not present in the source text and does not fit the context of the translation.
The correct translation is: 關於 %1
```

```
        <source>About Qt</source>
        <translation>關於 Qt Q</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it includes an extraneous character 'Q' at the end of the translation. The correct translation should be "關於 Qt".
關於 Qt
```

```
        <source>Send</source>
        <translation>付款 S</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The character 'S' after '付款' is an extraneous character that is not present in the source text. It seems to be a typo or an incomplete input.

Correct translation: 付款
```

```
        <source>Receive</source>
        <translation>收款 R</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains an extraneous character "R" at the end of the translated word.
The correct translation should be: 收款
```

```
        <source>Backup Wallet…</source>
        <translation>备份钱包(B)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it uses simplified Chinese characters for "备份钱包" instead of traditional Chinese characters, which is expected for Hong Kong Chinese (zh_HK). Also, the shortcut key indicator "(B)" is not typically used in zh_HK translations. The correct translation should use traditional Chinese characters and a more appropriate shortcut indicator if necessary.

Correct translation: 備份錢包(B)
```

```
        <source>Change Passphrase…</source>
        <translation>修改密码(C)</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses a simplified Chinese character "码" which is not typically used in Hong Kong traditional Chinese. The correct translation should use "碼".
修改密碼(C)
```

```
        <source>Load PSBT from file…</source>
        <translation>从文件加载PSBT(L)...</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses the simplified Chinese character "从" instead of the traditional Chinese character "從". It also uses the simplified Chinese character "加载" instead of the traditional Chinese character "載入".

Correct translation: 從檔案載入PSBT(L)...
```

```
        <source>Open URI…</source>
        <translation>打开URI...</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The original English text uses "Open URI…" which in the context of Bitcoin, especially in a user interface, should be translated to something that accurately reflects opening a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that could be a Bitcoin payment request. The provided translation "打开URI..." is a direct translation from Simplified Chinese "打开URI..." (dǎkāi URI), which is not the standard or preferred terminology in Hong Kong Cantonese (zh_HK).

In zh_HK, the term for "Open" when referring to a URI or a link is typically "開啟" (hoi1 kai1) rather than "打开" (da3 hoi2). Also, the ellipsis "…" should be preserved.

The correct translation should be:
<translation>開啟URI…</translation>
```

```
        <source>Close Wallet…</source>
        <translation>关闭钱包...</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The provided translation uses simplified Chinese characters (关闭) which is not appropriate for the target language zh_HK (Traditional Chinese).

NO
```

```
        <source>Create Wallet…</source>
        <translation>创建钱包...</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The target language is zh_HK (Hong Kong Cantonese), but the translation uses simplified Chinese characters (创建, 钱包) which are commonly used in Mainland China. The correct translation for Hong Kong Cantonese would use traditional Chinese characters.

NO
```

```
        <source>File</source>
        <translation>檔案 F</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The letter "F" in the translation is not part of the original English text, nor does it serve any apparent purpose in this context.
檔案
```

```
        <source>Settings</source>
        <translation>設定 S</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains an extraneous character "S" at the end of the translated text.
Correct translation: 設定
```

```
        <source>Help</source>
        <translation>說明 H</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains an extraneous character "H" at the end of the word "說明". The correct translation should be "說明".
NO
```

```
        <source>Connecting to peers…</source>
        <translation>连接到节点...</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses Simplified Chinese characters ("连接到节点") instead of Traditional Chinese characters ("連接到節點") which are appropriate for Hong Kong.
NO
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses</source>
        <translation>付款地址(S)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. It is unclear and the addition of "(S)" is incorrect.

Correct translation: 付款地址
```

```
        <source>Open a bitcoin: URI</source>
        <translation>打开bitcoin:开头的URI</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "开头的URI" which means "URI starting with" but the original English text is "Open a bitcoin: URI", meaning to open a URI that begins with "bitcoin:". The current translation implies opening a URI that has "bitcoin:" at the beginning which is accurate, but the term "open" has been translated to "打开" which means "to open" but in this context it should mean "launch" or "initiate" a process that will open the URI. The phrase "bitcoin:" should be kept as it is, as it is a specific protocol identifier. Also, the term "URI" is commonly understood as a web address, and in this context, it means a link to a bitcoin wallet. The current translation is a bit literal.

Correct translation:
<translation>開啟 bitcoin: URI</translation>
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>卸载钱包</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because "卸载钱包" means "uninstall wallet", which is not the same as "close wallet". A closer translation would be "關閉錢包" or "關閉錢包".

NO
```

```
        <source>Migrate a wallet</source>
        <translation>迁移一个钱包</translation>
    
YES, the translation is erroneous. The Traditional Chinese character for "migrate" should be "移轉" or "遷移", not "迁移".

NO
```

```
        <source>Hide</source>
        <translation>躲</translation>
    
YES, the translation is inaccurate. "Hide" in the context of user interfaces typically means to conceal something from view. The provided translation "躲" means to dodge or hide from something, which is not the intended meaning. A more appropriate translation would be "隱藏".

NO
```

```
        <source>Enable network activity</source>
        <extracomment>A context menu item. The network activity was disabled previously.</extracomment>
        <translation>關閉網路紀錄</translation>
    
YES. The translation is incorrect and conveys the opposite meaning of the source text. The source text "Enable network activity" indicates turning on network activity, while the translation "關閉網路紀錄" means "Close network record".

Correct translation: 啟用網路活動
```

```
        <source>Amount:</source>
        <translation>金额:</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate for the context of Bitcoin transactions. In Hong Kong Cantonese, "amount" in this context is typically translated as "金額". The current translation "金额" is Simplified Chinese.
Correct translation: 金額:
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>复制和数量</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of "Copy amount".
Correct translation: 複製金額
```

```
        <source>Lock unspent</source>
        <translation>锁定未花费(O)</translation>
    
YES
The translation includes an unnecessary "(O)" which is likely a placeholder or formatting artifact.
Correct translation: 锁定未花费
```

```
        <source>Migrate wallet</source>
        <translation>迁移钱包</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The correct translation for "Migrate wallet" in zh_HK is "轉移錢包" or "遷移錢包".
YES, The translation is incorrect. The correct translation for "Migrate wallet" in zh_HK is "轉移錢包" or "遷移錢包".
```

```
        <source>Migrating Wallet &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt;…</source>
        <translation>迁移钱包 &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt;...</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses simplified Chinese characters instead of traditional Chinese characters which is required for zh_HK.
Migrating Wallet &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt;…
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>卸载钱包</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because "卸载钱包" means "uninstall wallet", which is not the same as "close wallet". A closer translation would be "關閉錢包" or "關閉錢包".

NO
```

```
        <source>Closing the wallet for too long can result in having to resync the entire chain if pruning is enabled.</source>
        <translation>启用修剪时，如果一个钱包被卸载太久，就必须重新同步整条区块链才能再次加载它。</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic as it misinterprets "closing the wallet for too long" as "unloading the wallet for too long". It also incorrectly translates "resync the entire chain" to "resynchronize the entire blockchain to load it again".

The correct translation should be:
启用修剪时，如果钱包长时间未关闭，可能需要重新同步整个链。
```

```
        <source>Edit Address</source>
        <translation>编辑地址</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The provided translation uses simplified Chinese characters (编辑地址), while the target language is Traditional Chinese for Hong Kong (zh_HK).

NO
```

```
        <source>Edit sending address</source>
        <translation>编辑付款地址</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and doesn't accurately reflect the original English text. "Sending address" in the context of Bitcoin typically refers to the address from which the Bitcoin is being sent, which is the wallet address of the sender. The provided Chinese translation "编辑付款地址" translates to "Edit payment address", which is vague and could also refer to the receiving address. A more accurate translation would be "編輯寄送地址" or "編輯付款方地址".

Edit sending address
```

```
        <source>Address "%1" already exists as a receiving address with label "%2" and so cannot be added as a sending address.</source>
        <translation>地址“%1”為已登記存在“%2”的地址，因此無法新增為發送地址。</translation>
    
YES - The translation incorrectly implies that the existing address is only a "receiving address" (`接收地址`) when the source text states it exists as a receiving address *with a label*. The "%2" placeholder is also missing its surrounding quotation marks.

Correct translation: 地址「%1」已作為標記為「%2」的接收地址存在，因此無法新增為發送地址。
```

```
        <source>When you click OK, %1 will begin to download and process the full %4 block chain (%2 GB) starting with the earliest transactions in %3 when %4 initially launched.</source>
        <translation>當你點擊「確認」，%1會開始下載，並從%3年最早的交易，處裡整個%4區塊鏈(大小:%2GB)</translation>
    
YES - The translation is missing the format specifier `%4` in the sentence. It should be "處裡整個%4區塊鏈(大小:%2GB)". The correct translation is: 當你點擊「確認」，%1會開始下載，並從%3年最早的交易，處裡整個%4區塊鏈(大小:%2GB)。
```

```
        <source>About %1</source>
        <translation>关于 %1</translation>
    
YES, The translation for 'About %1' should be '關於 %1' to be accurate for traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) and to correctly use the traditional Chinese character for 'about'.
關於 %1
```

```
        <source>Start %1 on system login</source>
        <translation>系统登入时启动 %1 (S)</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it unnecessarily includes "(S)" at the end of the sentence. This looks like it could be a placeholder that wasn't properly translated or removed.
The correct translation should be: 系统登入时启动 %1
```

```
        <source>Network</source>
        <translation>网络(N)</translation>
    
YES - The provided translation uses a simplified Chinese character '网' (wǎng) instead of the traditional Chinese character '網' (wǎng) which is appropriate for Hong Kong.
Correct translation: 網絡(N)
```

```
        <source>This allows you or a third party tool to communicate with the node through command-line and JSON-RPC commands.</source>
        <extracomment>Tooltip text for Options window setting that enables the RPC server.</extracomment>
        <translation>这允许作为用户的你或第三方工具通过命令行和JSON-RPC命令行与节点通信。</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses "命令行" twice which is redundant. The original English text uses "command-line" once. The translation should be: "这允许您或第三方工具通过命令行和JSON-RPC命令与节点通信。"
```

```
        <source>Expert</source>
        <translation>专家</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses simplified Chinese characters. The correct translation in traditional Chinese characters for Hong Kong (zh_HK) should be:

專家
```

```
        <source>Spend unconfirmed change</source>
        <translation>动用尚未确认的找零资金(S)</translation>
    
YES - The character "(S)" at the end of the translation is not present in the source text and is likely an error or extraneous content. The correct translation should be "動用尚未確認的找零資金".
動用尚未確認的找零資金
```

```
        <source>Allow incoming connections</source>
        <translation>允许传入连接(G)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the character 'G' in parentheses is not part of the original English text and appears to be an unnecessary addition or a misunderstanding of keyboard shortcuts. The correct translation should not include it.

NO, 允许传入连接
```

```
        <source>Connect through SOCKS5 proxy (default proxy):</source>
        <translation>通过 SOCKS5 代理连接(默认代理):</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses simplified Chinese characters (通过) instead of traditional Chinese characters (通過), which is required for zh_HK.
Correct translation: 通過 SOCKS5 代理連接 (默認代理):
```

```
        <source>Continue</source>
        <translation>继续</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. "Continue" in the context of Bitcoin should be translated to 繼續 (gaai juk).
NO
```

```
        <source>Your current balance in watch-only addresses</source>
        <translation>您当前在仅观察观察地址中的余额</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains a grammatical error and redundancy. The phrase "仅观察观察地址" (jǐn guānchá guānchá dìzhǐ) literally translates to "only observe observe address", which is repetitive and unnatural. A more accurate and concise translation would be "僅觀察地址" (gǐn guānchá dìzhǐ), meaning "watch-only addresses".

NO
```

```
        <source>Mined balance in watch-only addresses that has not yet matured</source>
        <translation>仅观察地址中尚未成熟的挖矿收入余额:</translation>
    
YES - The translation contains an extraneous colon at the end of the sentence, which is not present in the source text.

Correct translation: 仅观察地址中尚未成熟的挖矿收入余额
```

```
        <source>Current total balance in watch-only addresses</source>
        <translation>仅观察地址中的当前总余额</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and unnatural for a Cantonese speaker.
Correct translation: 觀察專用地址的總餘額
```

```
        <source>Save…</source>
        <translation>拯救...</translation>
    
YES: The translation of "Save…" to "拯救..." is incorrect in the context of Bitcoin. "拯救" means "rescue" or "save" in the sense of rescuing someone or something from danger. In a Bitcoin context, "Save…" typically refers to saving a file or settings, and a more appropriate translation would be "儲存…" or "保存…".

Correct translation: 儲存…
```

```
        <source>Could not sign any more inputs.</source>
        <translation>没有交易输入项可供签名了。</translation>
    
YES - The translation is a literal translation and does not accurately reflect the meaning of the source text in the context of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, "inputs" refer to the UTXOs being spent in a transaction, and "signing" refers to the cryptographic process of authorizing the transaction with a private key. The translated phrase "没有交易输入项可供签名了" is grammatically correct but doesn't convey the technical meaning correctly.

A more appropriate translation would be:
"未能签署更多交易输入。"
```

```
        <source>PSBT copied to clipboard.</source>
        <translation>已复制PSBT到剪贴板</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses a simplified Chinese character "剪" which is not standard in traditional Chinese (Hong Kong). Additionally, there is a missing space before "剪贴板".
已將 PSBT 複製到剪貼簿。
```

```
        <source>Cannot start bitcoin: click-to-pay handler</source>
        <translation>无法启动 bitcoin: 协议的“一键支付”处理程序</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses "无法启动 bitcoin" which literally means "Cannot start bitcoin". However, the context suggests that the message is displayed when the Bitcoin client cannot start its "click-to-pay" handler, not that the Bitcoin client itself cannot be started. The translated phrase is misleading and could cause confusion.

A more accurate translation would be:

"未能啟動 Bitcoin 的「一鍵支付」處理程序"
```

```
        <source>Inbound</source>
        <extracomment>An Inbound Connection from a Peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>進來</translation>
    
YES - The translation is too literal and doesn't convey the intended meaning in the context of Bitcoin. A better translation would be "入站連接" (inbound connection) or simply "入站" (inbound) when referring to a connection type.
        <source>Inbound</source>
        <extracomment>An Inbound Connection from a Peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>入站連接</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy Image</source>
        <translation>复制图像(C)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is accurate but includes an unnecessary and unlocalized shortcut indicator "(C)". It should be removed for a cleaner and more appropriate translation in Hong Kong Chinese.

Correct translation: 複製圖像
```

```
        <source>Information</source>
        <translation>資訊 I</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because it includes an extra "I" at the end of "資訊" (information). This is an erroneous addition and disrupts the intended meaning.

Correct translation: 資訊
```

```
        <source>Datadir</source>
        <translation>数据目录</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The character set used is simplified Chinese, not traditional Chinese used in Hong Kong. The correct translation should be "數據目錄".

NO
```

```
        <source>Memory Pool</source>
        <translation>内存池</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters instead of Traditional Chinese characters. The correct translation should be 記憶體池.
```

```
        <source>(none)</source>
        <translation>(无)</translation>
    
YES - The translation "(无)" is the simplified Chinese translation for "(none)". The traditional Chinese translation for "(none)" is "(無)".
(無)
```

```
        <source>Hide Peers Detail</source>
        <translation>隐藏其他人的详细信息</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and problematic. The Chinese translation "隐藏其他人的详细信息" (Hide other people's details) is not a correct translation of "Hide Peers Detail" in the context of Bitcoin. "Peers" in Bitcoin refers to other nodes on the network, not "other people".

A more accurate translation would be:

Hide Peers Detail -> 隱藏節點詳細資訊
```

```
        <source>The transport layer version: %1</source>
        <translation>传输层版本: %1</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses simplified Chinese characters instead of traditional Chinese characters. The correct translation should be: 傳輸層版本: %1
```

```
        <source>Decrease font size</source>
        <translation>缩小字体大小</translation>
    
YES, the translation for "Decrease font size" to Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) is incorrect. The provided translation "缩小字体大小" is in Simplified Chinese.

The correct translation for "Decrease font size" in Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) is:
<translation>縮小字體大小</translation>
```

```
        <source>Open</source>
        <translation>打开(O)</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The translation "打开(O)" includes a hotkey annotation "(O)" which is not present in the source text. The source text "Open" does not imply a hotkey.

NO
```

        <source>Outbound Address Fetch: short-lived, for soliciting addresses</source>
        <extracomment>Explanatory text for a short-lived outbound peer connection that is used to request addresses from a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Outbound 地址取得: 用於短暫，暫時 測試地址</translation>
    
YES - The translation is too literal and doesn't accurately convey the meaning of "soliciting addresses". The word "測試" (test) is also not present in the source.

Correct translation:
Outbound 地址取得：暫時性，用於徵求地址
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <extracomment>Context menu action to copy the address of a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>复制地址(C)</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses simplified Chinese characters (复制) instead of traditional Chinese characters (複製). The extracomment indicates that the context is a menu action, which should typically be in the traditional Chinese for Hong Kong.
Correct translation: 複製地址(C)
```

```
        <source>Disconnect</source>
        <translation>断开(D)</translation>
    
YES, The Chinese translation contains an unnecessary English letter "D" in parentheses.
断开
```

```
        <source>1 hour</source>
        <translation>1 小时(H)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and problematic because of the unnecessary addition of "(H)" which does not correspond to the source text.
The correct translation is: 1 小时
```

```
        <source>Copy message</source>
        <translation>复制消息(M)</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters instead of Traditional Chinese characters, which are used in Hong Kong. Additionally, the provided character is 'M' which is an English letter and does not have a corresponding traditional Chinese character.
The correct translation is: 複製訊息(M)
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>复制和数量</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of "Copy amount".
Correct translation: 複製金額
```

```
        <source>Request payment to …</source>
        <translation>请求支付至...</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses simplified Chinese characters (请求, 至) which are not standard for Hong Kong traditional Chinese. The correct translation should use traditional Chinese characters.
请求支付至...
```

```
        <source>Amount:</source>
        <translation>金额:</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate for the context of Bitcoin transactions. In Hong Kong Cantonese, "amount" in this context is typically translated as "金額". The current translation "金额" is Simplified Chinese.
Correct translation: 金額:
```

```
        <source>Request payment to %1</source>
        <translation>付款給 %1 的要求</translation>
    
YES, The translation is awkward and not idiomatic. The structure is reversed from the English source.
Correct translation: 要求向 %1 付款
```

```
        <source>Amount:</source>
        <translation>金额:</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate for the context of Bitcoin transactions. In Hong Kong Cantonese, "amount" in this context is typically translated as "金額". The current translation "金额" is Simplified Chinese.
Correct translation: 金額:
```

```
        <source>Custom change address</source>
        <translation>自定义找零地址</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters ("自定义找零地址") instead of Traditional Chinese characters, which are expected for the 'zh_HK' locale. The correct translation should use Traditional Chinese.
Custom change address
```

```
        <source>Choose…</source>
        <translation>选择...</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not appropriate for the zh_HK locale. The traditional Chinese character for "Choose" is "選擇".
NO
```

```
        <source>Enable Replace-By-Fee</source>
        <translation>启用手续费追加</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not idiomatic and doesn't accurately convey the meaning of "Replace-By-Fee" in the context of Bitcoin transactions. The term "手续费追加" literally translates to "fee addition," which is too general and doesn't capture the specific concept of replacing the fee of an existing unconfirmed transaction. A more accurate translation would be "启用交易费替换" or "啟用交易費替換" (in traditional Chinese).

NO
```

```
        <source>Send</source>
        <translation>发送(E)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The correct translation for "Send" in the context of Bitcoin in Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) is "發送".

NO
```

```
        <source>Sign on device</source>
        <extracomment>"device" usually means a hardware wallet.</extracomment>
        <translation>在設備上簽證</translation>
    
YES, The translation "在設備上簽證" is not the most natural or accurate translation for "Sign on device" in the context of Bitcoin and hardware wallets. "簽證" (wēizhèng) means "visa" or "certificate," which is not appropriate here. The correct term for signing with a hardware wallet is usually related to "signing" a transaction.

NO
```

```
        <source>Create Unsigned</source>
        <translation>创建未签名交易(E)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it is not in Traditional Chinese (zh_HK), which is the requested language. The provided translation uses Simplified Chinese characters.

NO
```

```
        <source>Please, review your transaction proposal. This will produce a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) which you can save or copy and then sign with e.g. an offline %1 wallet, or a PSBT-compatible hardware wallet.</source>

YES: The original translation is grammatically incorrect and confusing. It fails to convey the intended meaning of signing the PSBT with an offline or hardware wallet. The phrase "然後使用簽名" (then use signature) is out of place and doesn't connect properly with the wallet types mentioned.

Correct translation: 請檢查您的交易提案。這將產生一個部分簽名的比特幣交易（PSBT），您可以儲存或複製它，然後使用例如離線%1錢包或支援PSBT的硬體錢包進行簽名。
```

```
        <source>Confirm send coins</source>
        <translation>确认发币</translation>
    
YES - The translation "确认发币" is an accurate translation of "Confirm send coins". However, in the context of Bitcoin transactions, it's more common to use "发送比特币" or "支付" for sending coins. The term "发币" can sometimes imply issuing new coins, which is not the intended meaning here. A more contextually appropriate translation would be "确认发送比特币" or "确认支付".

Correct translation: 确认发送比特币
```

```
        <source>The amount exceeds your balance.</source>
        <translation>金额超出您的余额。</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters (金额, 您, 余额) instead of Traditional Chinese characters. The correct translation in Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) should be: 錢包結餘不足。
```

```
        <source>A fee higher than %1 is considered an absurdly high fee.</source>
        <translation>超过 %1 的手续费被视为高得离谱。</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Simplified Chinese characters ("超过", "被视为") instead of Traditional Chinese characters, which are expected for zh_HK.

Correct translation:
<translation>高過 %1 的費用被視為高得離譜。</translation>
```

```
        <source>The Bitcoin address to send the payment to</source>
        <translation>將支付發送到的比特幣地址給</translation>
    
YES, The translation is grammatically incorrect and awkward in Chinese. The intended meaning is "The Bitcoin address to which the payment will be sent." A more natural and accurate translation would be:

將支付發送到的比特幣地址
```

```
        <source>Subtract fee from amount</source>
        <translation>從付款金額減去手續費(U)</translation>
    
YES - The translation includes an unexplained "(U)" which is not present in the source text. The correct translation should omit this.
從付款金額減去手續費
```

```
        <source>Send</source>
        <translation>发送</translation>
    
YES, The translation of "Send" to "发送" is generally correct, but in the context of Bitcoin and Hong Kong Cantonese, "發送" (faat1 sung3) is a more common and appropriate term. "发送" (fa1 song3) is more commonly used in Mainland China Mandarin.

Correct translation: 發送
```

```
        <source>Verify Message</source>
        <translation>验证消息签名(M)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it includes an unnecessary and incorrect character. The original English text is "Verify Message" and the translation provided is "验证消息签名(M)". The "(M)" is not part of the original text and serves no functional purpose in this context.

The correct translation should be:
<source>Verify Message</source>
<translation>驗證訊息</translation>
```

```
        <source>The signature could not be decoded.</source>
        <translation>签名无法解码。</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses Simplified Chinese characters instead of Traditional Chinese characters.
The correct translation is: 簽署無法解碼。
```

```
        <source>%1/unconfirmed</source>
        <extracomment>Text explaining the current status of a transaction, shown in the status field of the details window for this transaction. This status represents a transaction confirmed in at least one block, but less than 6 blocks.</extracomment>
        <translation>%1 次/未確認</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. The "%1/unconfirmed" format indicates a fraction or ratio, and the translation "%1 次/未確認" implies that "%1" is a count of confirmations, which is inaccurate given the context of the transaction status. The correct translation should reflect that the transaction has a certain number of confirmations but is still considered unconfirmed in the broader sense of reaching the target number of confirmations (e.g., 6).

Correct translation: %1 次 / 未確認 (which is also incorrect, but closer than the original proposed translation.)

A more accurate translation would be:
%1 次 / 待確認
```

```
        <source>Confirming (%1 of %2 recommended confirmations)</source>
        <translation>确认中 (推荐 %2个确认，已经有 %1个确认)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and confusing. It incorrectly reverses the order of the confirmation counts and uses awkward phrasing. The correct translation should be "確認中 (已獲 %1 個確認，建議 %2 個確認)".
```

```
        <source>Sent to</source>
        <translation>发送到</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and uses simplified Chinese characters instead of traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong.
Correct translation: 發送到
```

```
        <source>Sent to</source>
        <translation>发送到</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and uses simplified Chinese characters instead of traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong.
Correct translation: 發送到
```

```
        <source>Range…</source>
        <translation>范围...</translation>
    
YES, The translation of "Range…" to "范围..." is incorrect. The correct translation for "Range…" in the context of Bitcoin, specifically referring to a range of addresses or values, would be "範圍…".

NO
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>复制和数量</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of "Copy amount".
Correct translation: 複製金額
```

```
        <source>Increase transaction fee</source>
        <translation>增加矿工费(F)</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses an English abbreviation "F" which is not standard in Chinese. The term "miner fee" is more commonly translated as "礦工費" or "交易手續費".

NO
```

```
        <source>Edit address label</source>
        <translation>编辑地址标签(E)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The character "编辑" is simplified Chinese, while the target language is Traditional Chinese. Also, the parenthesized letter "(E)" should be "（E）" for Traditional Chinese.
NO, EDIT ADDRESS LABEL
```

```
        <source>Unable to decode PSBT from clipboard (invalid base64)</source>
        <translation>无法从剪贴板解码PSBT(Base64值无效)</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses simplified Chinese characters instead of traditional Chinese characters.
无法从剪贴板解码PSBT (Base64 值無效)
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>匯出 E</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic because it incorrectly appends an "E" to the translated word. This could be a typo or an artifact from the translation process. The "E" should be removed for a correct translation.
匯出
```

```
        <source>Error starting/committing db txn for wallet transactions removal process</source>
        <translation>错误：启动/提交数据库事务时出错，导致钱包交易移除过程失败。</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains an erroneous translation of "Error". In this context, "Error" should be translated as "錯誤" rather than "错误". Additionally, the phrasing "导致钱包交易移除过程失败" is a bit clunky and can be improved for natural flow.

Corrected translation: 錯誤：啟動/提交資料庫交易時出錯，移除錢包交易過程中出現錯誤。
```

```
        <source>Error: Dumpfile identifier record is incorrect. Got "%s", expected "%s".</source>
        <translation>
錯誤：轉存檔案識別記錄不正確。獲得%s，預期

YES - The translation is missing the closing quotation mark for the first "%s" and the opening quotation mark for the second "%s".

Correct translation: 錯誤：轉存檔案識別記錄不正確。獲得 "%s"，預期 "%s"。
```

```
        <source>More than one onion bind address is provided. Using %s for the automatically created Tor onion service.</source>
        <translation>提供多數TOR路由綁定位址。 對自動建立的Tor服務用%s</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains a mistranslation and a grammatical error. The phrase "提供多數TOR路由綁定位址" translates to "Provided more TOR routing bind address", which is grammatically incorrect and doesn't convey the intended meaning of the source text. The phrase "對自動建立的Tor服務用%s" translates to "Use %s for automatically created Tor service", which is also a bit awkward in Chinese.

A more accurate and natural translation would be:
"提供多於一個 Onion 綁定位址。將使用 %s 作為自動建立的 Tor Onion 服務。"
```

```
        <source>Prune mode is incompatible with -reindex-chainstate. Use full -reindex instead.</source>
        <translation>修剪模式与 -reindex-chainstate 不兼容。请进行一次完整的 -reindex 。</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses simplified Chinese characters instead of traditional Chinese characters for Hong Kong. Additionally, the translation uses a period at the end of the sentence, which is not typically used in this context in traditional Chinese.

Correct translation: 修剪模式與 -reindex-chainstate 不兼容。請進行一次完整的 -reindex 。
```

```
        <source>This is the maximum transaction fee you pay (in addition to the normal fee) to prioritize partial spend avoidance over regular coin selection.</source>
        <translation>這是您支付的最高交易手續費（除了正常手續費外），優先於避免部分花費而不是定期選取幣。</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it misinterprets the meaning of "partial spend avoidance" and "regular coin selection". It should be:

這是您支付的最高交易手續費（除了正常手續費外），用於優先避免部分花費，而不是常規的選幣。
```

```
        <source>This is the transaction fee you may discard if change is smaller than dust at this level</source>
        <translation>找零低于当前粉尘阈值时会被舍弃，并计入手续费，这些交易手续费就是在这种情况下产生的。</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The original English sentence states that the transaction fee may be discarded if the change is smaller than dust. The provided Chinese translation, however, states that the change will be discarded and included in the transaction fee if it's smaller than the dust threshold, which is the opposite of the original meaning.

Correct translation:
<translation>如果找零低于当前粉尘阈值，您或许可以舍弃此笔交易费用。</translation>
```

```
        <source>Unknown wallet file format "%s" provided. Please provide one of "bdb" or "sqlite".</source>
        <translation>提供了未知的钱包格式 "%s" 。请使用 "bdb" 或 "sqlite" 中的一种。</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses simplified Chinese characters ("了", "钱包", "格式", "提供", "使用", "或") instead of traditional Chinese characters common in Hong Kong ("咗", "錢包", "格式", "提供", "使用", "或").
NO
```

```
        <source>Cannot resolve -%s address: '%s'</source>
        <translation>沒辦法解析 -%s 參數指定的地址: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation incorrectly uses the word "parameter" (參數) which is not present in the original English text. The word "address" in the English text refers to a Bitcoin address.

Correct translation: 無法解析 -%s 地址：「%s」
```

```
        <source>%s is set very high! Fees this large could be paid on a single transaction.</source>
        <translation>%s被设置得很高! 这可是一次交易就有可能付出的手续费。</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "change" in the source text refers to "change amount" in a Bitcoin transaction, but the translation uses "手续费" which means "transaction fee". The sentence should convey that a very high fee could be paid on a single transaction, not that the high fee itself is the change.

NO
```

```
        <source>Error: Duplicate descriptors created during migration. Your wallet may be corrupted.</source>
        <translation>错误：迁移过程中创建了重复的输出描述符。你的钱包可能已损坏。</translation>
    
YES - The term "输出描述符" is a literal translation of "output descriptors" and doesn't accurately convey the meaning in the context of Bitcoin, which refers to Bitcoin descriptors. A more appropriate translation would be "Bitcoin 描述符" or "描述符".

Correct translation: 错误：迁移过程中创建了重复的Bitcoin描述符。你的钱包可能已损坏。
```

```
        <source>Invalid amount for %s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' (must be at least the minrelay fee of %s to prevent stuck transactions)</source>
        <translation>%s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' 中指定了非法的金额 (手续费必须至少达到最小转发费率(minrelay fee) %s 以避免交易卡着发不出去)</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and grammatically incorrect. The original English sentence structure is not followed, and the phrasing "手续费必须至少达到最小转发费率(minrelay fee)" is awkward.

Correct translation:
%s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' 的金额无效 (必须至少是 %s 的最小转发费率，以避免交易卡住)
```

```
        <source>Transaction requires one destination of non-0 value, a non-0 feerate, or a pre-selected input</source>
        <translation>交易要求一个非零值目标，或是非零值手续费率，或是预选中的输入。</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses simplified Chinese characters ("要求", "一个", "值", "或是", "费率", "选中的") instead of traditional Chinese characters ("要求", "一個", "值", "或是", "費率", "選中的").
NO
```

```
        <source>Unexpected legacy entry in descriptor wallet found. Loading wallet %s

The wallet might have been tampered with or created with malicious intent.
</source>
        <translation>在描述符钱包中意料之外地找到了旧式条目。加载钱包%s

钱包可能被篡改过，或者是出于恶意而被构建的。
</translation>
    
YES, The Chinese translation is grammatically correct, but the word "意料之外地" is too literal and sounds unnatural. A more idiomatic translation would be "意外地".

Here's the corrected translation:
YES, 在描述符钱包中意外地找到了旧式条目。加载钱包%s

钱包可能被篡改过，或者是出于恶意而被构建的。
```

```
        <source>Disk space is too low!</source>
        <translation>磁盘空间太低!</translation>
    
YES, The provided translation uses a simplified Chinese character ("磁盘") instead of the traditional Chinese characters commonly used in Hong Kong ("磁碟").
Correct translation: 磁碟空間太低！
```

```
        <source>Error loading %s: Private keys can only be disabled during creation</source>
        <translation>載入 %s 時發生錯誤: 只有在造新錢包時能夠指定不允許私鑰</translation>
    
YES - The translation incorrectly interprets "disabled during creation" as "not allowed to specify private keys during creation". The original English means that private keys can only be *disabled* at the time of *creating* a new wallet. The translation implies that private keys cannot be specified at all during creation, which is a misunderstanding.

Correct translation: 載入 %s 時發生錯誤：私鑰只能在建立時停用
```

```
        <source>Error: Couldn't create cursor into database</source>
        <translation>错误: 无法在数据库中创建指针</translation>
    
YES, The term "cursor" in the context of a database usually refers to a control structure that enables traversal over the records of a database. In Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong), the word for "pointer" (指针) is often used to refer to a programming concept rather than a database cursor. A more appropriate translation for "cursor" in this context would be "游標" or "游標".

Correct translation: 錯誤: 無法在資料庫中建立游標
```

```
        <source>Error: Dumpfile checksum does not match. Computed %s, expected %s</source>
        <translation>錯誤：轉存檔案的校驗和不匹配。%s計算得%s</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because the format specifiers are not correctly translated. The original English text has two format specifiers '%s', but the translated text only has one. The correct translation should have two format specifiers to accurately represent the computed and expected checksums.

NO
```

```
        <source>Error: Unable to parse version %u as a uint32_t</source>
        <translation>错误：无法把版本号%u作为unit32_t解析</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses simplified Chinese characters (错误, 无法, 把, 作为) instead of traditional Chinese characters (錯誤, 無法, 把, 作為) which are standard in Hong Kong. Also, the term "unit32_t" is likely a typo for "uint32_t".

Correct translation: 錯誤：無法將版本號 %u 解析為 uint32_t
```

```
        <source>Error: Unable to write data to disk for wallet %s</source>
        <translation>错误：无法将数据写入钱包的磁盘%s。</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the format specifier %s is placed incorrectly. It should be at the end of the sentence.
Error: Unable to write data to disk for wallet %s
错误：无法将数据写入钱包的磁盘 %s。
```

```
        <source>Failure removing transaction: %s</source>
        <translation>%s删除交易时失败: </translation>
    
YES: The translation has a punctuation error. The colon at the end of the English source is missing in the Chinese translation.

%s 移除交易時失敗：
```

```
        <source>Fee rate (%s) is lower than the minimum fee rate setting (%s)</source>
        <translation>手续费率 (%s) 低于最大手续费率设置 (%s)</translation>
    
YES, The translation incorrectly translates "minimum" to "maximum". The correct translation for "minimum fee rate setting" is "最低手续费率设置".

NO
```

```
        <source>Invalid amount for %s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' (must be at least %s)</source>
        <translation>%s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' 中指定了非法的金额 (必须至少达到 %s)</translation>
    
YES - The translation incorrectly uses "Amount" instead of "Amount" in the sentence. The correct translation should be: "%s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' 中指定了非法的金额 (必须至少达到 %s)".
```

```
        <source>Invalid pre-selected input %s</source>
        <translation>无效的预先选择输入%s</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses simplified Chinese characters instead of traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong. Also, the term "无效的" is a direct translation of "Invalid" which sounds unnatural in this context. A better translation would be "不正確的".

Correct translation: 不正確的預設選項輸入 %s
```

```
        <source>Not found pre-selected input %s</source>
        <translation>找不到预先选择输入%s</translation>
    
YES, the translation is inaccurate. The translation uses simplified Chinese characters instead of traditional Chinese characters.

NO
```

```
        <source>Not solvable pre-selected input %s</source>
        <translation>无法求解的预先选择输入%s</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses simplified Chinese characters while the target language is Traditional Chinese (zh_HK).
无法求解的預先選擇輸入%s
```

```
        <source>Pruning blockstore…</source>
        <translation>修剪区块存储...</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. While "修剪区块存储" is a literal translation, it's not the idiomatic or commonly used term in Chinese for this context. In Bitcoin contexts, the term often used is related to "pruning" the blockchain data.

The correct translation should be:
修剪區塊鏈存儲...
```

```
        <source>SQLiteDatabase: Failed to prepare statement to verify database: %s</source>
        <translation>SQLiteDatabase: 预处理用于校验数据库的语句时失败: %s</translation>
    
YES
The provided translation is incorrect. The character "校验" (jiào yàn) means "verify" or "check", which is not the intended meaning of "verify database". The correct translation should be "驗證" (yàn zhèng) or "核對" (hé duì).

Correct translation: SQLiteDatabase: 预处理用于验证数据库的语句时失败: %s
```

```
        <source>Transaction amounts must not be negative</source>
        <translation>交易金额不不可为负数</translation>
    
YES, The translation has a typo. "不不可" should be "不可". The correct translation is "交易金額不可為負數".
```

```
        <source>Transaction change output index out of range</source>
        <translation>交易尋找零輸出項超出範圍</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and uses a term that does not directly correspond to the meaning of "change output index" in a Bitcoin transaction context. In Bitcoin, "change output" refers to the portion of unspent transaction output (UTXO) returned to the sender when the transaction amount exceeds the cost of the transaction and fees. "Index" refers to the position of this output within the transaction's output list. The provided translation, "交易尋找零輸出項超出範圍", translates to "Transaction finding zero output item out of range", which does not accurately convey the concept of a change output index.

A more accurate translation would be:
交易變更輸出索引超出範圍
```

The correct translation should be: 钱包文件创建失败：%s
