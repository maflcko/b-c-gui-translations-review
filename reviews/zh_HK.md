# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

ERR
The translation includes the character "N", which is likely unintended and not part of the correct translation for "New". "新增" alone means "Add" or "New" in Hong Kong Chinese and suffices for UI purposes. There are no format specifiers in the source, so none are required in the translation.

Correct translation:
新增

The translation "触须" literally means "tentacle" or "antenna", which is not commonly used in Hong Kong Chinese for this network context. The correct translation in the context of Bitcoin (a connection that "feels/test probes" an address) should be more descriptive and locally accurate. In zh_HK, it would be clearer to use "探测连接" or "测试连接".

        <translation>修改密码(C)</translation>
    
ERR
The translation "修改密码(C)" is problematic for 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Chinese). 

1. 'Passphrase' should be rendered as「密碼短語」or「密碼片語」in the context of Bitcoin and crypto applications, as it is distinct from a simple 'password'（密碼）. Translating it as '密码' could mislead users.
2. The '(C)' shortcut marking does not fit the native zh_HK Windows/Mac style—it is neither needed nor local.
3. The ellipsis ("…") is missing in the translation.
4. '修改' is accurate for "change", but see above about "Passphrase".

Correct translation:
更改密碼短語…

or

更改密碼片語…

Either can be accepted as the standard for zh_HK, but 密碼短語 is more widely used.

ERR  
There are issues with accuracy, punctuation, and completeness:
1. The phrase "starting with the earliest transactions in %3 when %4 initially launched" isn't fully and clearly conveyed.
2. The word "處裡" is a common typo; the correct form is "處理".
3. The punctuation and spacing are off: "區塊鏈(大小:%2GB)" should have a space after "區塊鏈" and parentheses should be full-width or match HK norms.
4. The phrase "並從%3年最早的交易" introduces ambiguity and doesn't specify that %3 is a time.
5. Missing full stop at the end.

Correct translation:
當你點擊「確認」，%1 會開始下載和處理整個 %4 區塊鏈（%2 GB），由 %4 最初推出時、%3 年的最早交易開始。

Explanation:
- The translation has been restructured for clarity and smoothness in Cantonese/HK written Chinese.
- All format specifiers (%1, %2, %3, %4) have been preserved and placed appropriately.
- Full-width brackets are used as per HK style, and space issues are fixed.

Also, the tone and style are otherwise appropriate.

ERR
The translation is in Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) wording and style, not in Traditional Chinese as used in 'zh_HK'. Also, the term "消息签名" means "message signature" rather than just "message". Additionally, the original text does not have the accelerator "(M)".

Correct translation:
驗證訊息

If indicating the hotkey (M) is required based on context/UI guideline, it should be:
驗證訊息(M)

        <source>Increase transaction fee</source>
        <translation>增加矿工费(F)</translation>
    
ERR
The translation of "Increase transaction fee" as "增加矿工费(F)" is problematic for two reasons:
1. "矿工费" is more commonly used in Mainland China. In Hong Kong Cantonese ('zh_HK'), "手續費" (handling fee/transaction fee) is the standard expression.
2. The addition of "(F)" is unexplained and not present in the source; it introduces a stray format problem unless it has contextual meaning (like a shortcut indicator), which isn't specified here.

Correct translation:
增加交易手續費
```

There is an unnecessary line break before "%s" in the translated text, causing a formatting issue. Also, "獲得" is less natural than "收到" or "獲得了". For clarity and conformity with the original structure, the sentence should not break across lines, and the wording can be slightly refined.

1. The Chinese translation uses "多數TOR路由綁定位址", but "onion bind address" should be accurately rendered as "onion 綁定地址" or "onion 綁定位址", not "TOR路由綁定位址".
2. There is a missing space between sentences: "位址。 對自動建立的..." should remove the space after "。".
3. The translation omits "onion service", only saying "Tor服務", which is insufficiently specific.
4. "提供多數" translates to "provide multiple", but "More than one" is better translated as "超過一個".

Correct translation:
提供超過一個 onion 綁定位址。將使用 %s 作為自動建立的 Tor onion 服務。

ERR
The translation is understandable but has minor stylistic and punctuation issues inconsistent with 'zh_HK' (Hong Kong Cantonese) conventions. The exclamation mark should have a space before it according to CJK standards, and the tone is a bit off for HK Cantonese—should be more colloquial. Also, contextually, "这可是一次交易就有可能付出的手续费。" is awkward and doesn't accurately capture the warning tone or the information conveyed in the original.

Correct translation:
%s 設定得非常高！呢個咁大嘅手續費一單交易都可能要畀晒。

The translation uses simplified Chinese ("错误", "迁移", "创建", "描述符", "你的", "已损坏") instead of the expected traditional Chinese appropriate for 'zh_HK'. For Hong Kong ('zh_HK'), the translation should use traditional Chinese characters and local wording.

ERR
There are two issues:
1. The correct term in Hong Kong Cantonese should be "磁碟空間不足！" instead of "磁盘空间太低!", as "磁盘" and "空间太低" are more typical of Mainland Chinese usage ("磁碟" is used in Cantonese/HK, and "空間不足" is the idiomatic expression for "space is too low"/"insufficient space").
2. The exclamation mark should be a full-width Chinese exclamation mark: ！

Correct translation:
磁碟空間不足！

The translation is inaccurate. The English "Transaction change output index out of range" means that the index of the change output in the transaction is outside the allowable range.
