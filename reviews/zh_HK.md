        <translation>复制当前选中的地址到剪贴板。</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is in Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) instead of Traditional Chinese for Hong Kong (zh_HK). In Hong Kong, "复制" is commonly written as "複製", "选中" as "選取", and "剪贴板" as "剪貼簿". Additionally, the source text does not have a trailing period, so the translation should not include one.

Correct translation:
複製目前選取的地址至剪貼簿
```

        <translation>請記得將錢包加密不能完全防止你的 Bitcoins 經被入侵電腦的惡意程式偷取。</translation>
    
ERR
The translation contains grammatical awkwardness. The phrase "經被" is redundant or incorrect; it should likely be just "被" (by). Also, "Bitcoins" is typically translated as "比特幣" in Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong), or left as "Bitcoin" in singular form. The sentence structure also benefits from a comma after "請記得" (Please remember).

Correct translation:
請記住，加密錢包並不能完全防止你的比特幣被入侵電腦的惡意程式偷取。

The translation "手册" means "handbook" or "manual" in the sense of a physical or digital document. In the context of peer connection types, "Manual" refers to a manual action or setting. In Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong), the correct term for this context is "手動".

The translation of "unmask the values" and "Mask values" is inconsistent and confusing. "Mask values" in the source refers to a specific setting name. The translation "不明文显示数值" (Do not show values in plain text) for "Mask values" leads to a double negative when saying "uncheck... 'Do not show values in plain text'". In Cantonese/Traditional Chinese UI contexts for Bitcoin software, "Mask values" is typically translated as "遮蔽數值" or "隱藏數值".

        <translation>Outbound 地址取得: 用於短暫，暫時 測試地址</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is inaccurate and includes awkward phrasing. "用於短暫，暫時 測試地址" incorrectly suggests testing addresses ("測試地址") rather than soliciting/fetching them, and the grammar is repetitive.

Correct translation:
外連地址擷取：短暫，用於請求地址

The translation uses the term '金额' (amount), which is generic. In the context of Bitcoin and financial transactions, '餘額' (balance) or '資金' (funds) is more appropriate for "Insufficient funds".

ERR
The term "virtual size" in the context of Bitcoin (vsize) refers to a specific weight-based measurement of a transaction, not a "simulated" or "mock" size. The translation "擬真" means "simulated" or "realistic/quasi-real," which is incorrect in this technical context. The standard technical term for "virtual size" in Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong/Taiwan) is "虛擬大小".

Correct translation:
交易虛擬大小
