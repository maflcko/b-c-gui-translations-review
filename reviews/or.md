# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>ଠିକଣା ତାଲିକାକୁ ସଞ୍ଚୟ କରିବା ସମୟରେ ଏକ ତ୍ରୁଟି ହୋଇଛି%1. ଦୟାକରି ପୁନଃଚେଷ୍ଟା କରନ୍ତୁ</translation>
    
YES
There is a missing space before "%1" in the translation, causing a formatting issue. The translation should maintain the space from the original English sentence.

Correct translation:
ଠିକଣା ତାଲିକାକୁ ସଞ୍ଚୟ କରିବା ସମୟରେ ଏକ ତ୍ରୁଟି ହୋଇଛି %1। ଦୟାକରି ପୁନଃଚେଷ୍ଟା କରନ୍ତୁ।

        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>ଚେତାବନୀ: ଯଦି ତୁମେ ତୁମର ୱାଲେଟକୁ ଏନକ୍ରିପ୍ଟ କର ଏବଂ ତୁମର ପାସଫ୍ରେଜ୍ ହରାଇବ, ତୁମେ କରିବ &lt;b&gt;ଆପଣଙ୍କର ସମସ୍ତ ବିଟକଏନ୍ ହରାନ୍ତୁ&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>
    
YES
The translation is awkward and inconsistent with pronouns ("ତୁମେ", "ଆପଣଙ୍କର"). It also unnecessarily mixes formal and informal forms. The English source uses "you" consistently, so the translation should also be consistent and natural to Odia (Oriya).

Correct translation:
ଚେତାବନୀ: ଯଦି ଆପଣ ଆପଣଙ୍କ ୱାଲେଟକୁ ଏନକ୍ରିପ୍ଟ୍ କରନ୍ତି ଏବଂ ପାସଫ୍ରେଜ୍ ହରାଇଦେଇଛନ୍ତି, ତେବେ &lt;b&gt;ଆପଣଙ୍କ ସମସ୍ତ ବିଟକଏନ୍ ହରାଇପାରିବେ&lt;/b&gt;!
