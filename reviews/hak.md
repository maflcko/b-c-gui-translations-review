# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>刪除 D</translation>
    
ERR
The translation contains an unnecessary "D" character after "刪除", which is both a format and content error. The proper translation should only be "刪除" if that's the correct Hakka term for "Delete". If Hakka uses a different term distinct from Mandarin, that should be used, but "D" at the end is incorrect.

Correct translation:
刪除
```

The translation is in Simplified Chinese ("选择接收比特币地址"), not in the Hakka language ('hak') as requested.

Correct translation (in Hakka, using commonly accepted Hakka Romanization; text may vary based on regional standards, but a possible rendering is):
揀一個地址嚟收錢

(If Chinese characters are preferred: 揀一个地址来收銭)
```

The translation is in Simplified Chinese, not in Hakka ('hak'). "未捕获的异常" means "uncaught exception" in Chinese.

Correct translation (example in Hakka, using Latin transcription as commonly done):
Runaway exception: "走失个异常" (zou3 si1 ge3 yi4 co1).

Depending on the script standard, it might differ, but it should not be in Simplified Chinese.

The translation provided is in Chinese, not in the 'hak' language (likely Hakka). It does not meet the requirement for 'hak'.

Correct translation (approximate, in Hakka using Latin script as an example, since standard Hakka written form is not fixed and often uses Mandarin characters with localized pronunciation):

Liau tet bun chhi-hin e loh-chhi. Chhia chhak kio siet-thiet bun siong siong ho tsai-si soi, tsun-to hak-yu -nosettings gin-gi khi-hang.

(Note: For production usage, consult with a native Hakka speaker/writer and consider if Latin script or Han characters are preferred by your user base.)

        <source>Change the passphrase used for wallet encryption</source>

ERR
The translation "更改钱包密码" is in Chinese, not in Hakka ('hak'). Also, it omits the explicit mention of "encryption" and "passphrase", which may lose some nuance.

Correct translation (in Hakka, written in Latin Hakka, for best coverage):
Siu vui ong ngiau ong-hiun-ki tong-yung e mi-ma.

If native script or conventions are used in your project, adapt accordingly.

        <translation>修改密码(C)</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is in Simplified Chinese ("修改密码(C)"), not in 'hak' (Hakka). Additionally, the ellipsis (…) has been replaced by "(C)", which is not accurate.

Correct translation (approximate, as Hakka is not standardized in writing, but to show correct intent it could be phonetically represented):  
改善密碼…

Alternatively, if a widely accepted Hakka romanization or character is used for "change passphrase", it should be in Hakka, not standard Chinese.
```

        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>卸载钱包</translation>
    
ERR
The translation "卸载钱包" means "Uninstall wallet" in Chinese, which is incorrect for "Close wallet". The correct translation in Hakka should reflect 'closing' (not uninstalling). If using Hakka written in Chinese characters, a closer translation would be: "关闭钱包" or "閂钱包" (using the Hakka word for 'close').

Correct translation:
关闭钱包
```

ERR
The translation is incorrect in meaning. "Enable network activity" means to turn ON network activity, but the translation "關閉網路紀錄" means "Close/turn off network record". It is the opposite.

Correct translation (in Hakka, based on written Hakka and Han characters commonly used for UI):
開啟網路活動

If "hak" refers to Hakka Chinese, "開啟" (enable) and "網路活動" (network activity) are appropriate.
```

        <source>Amount:</source>
        <translation>金额(M)</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is in Chinese (金额), not Hakka ('hak'). '金额' means "amount" in Mandarin Chinese; there is no evidence of Hakka usage or script. Also, the extra '(M)' is unexplained and unnecessary.

Correct translation:
A more appropriate Hakka translation should reflect the Hakka language (which often still uses Chinese characters but has distinct vocabulary or notation). If using Chinese characters as commonly written in Hakka, it might be: 金額：

If Hakka Romanization is required: Kîm-ngiak:

But as per majority convention, just: 金額：

ERR
The translation is somewhat awkward in Hak (Hakka Chinese), and uses a phrase closer to Mandarin ("將支付發送到的比特幣地址給"), which is grammatically incorrect and possibly unclear.

Correct translation:
發送支付到的比特幣地址

Or, in more natural Hakka:
付款會發送到此比特幣地址

(Note: "付款會發送到此比特幣地址" means "The payment will be sent to this Bitcoin address". This phrasing is more natural and clear.)

The translation is in Chinese ('复制和数量' means 'Copy and amount') rather than in 'hak' (Hakka). 'hak' is the ISO code for Hakka Chinese, which should have distinctive Hakka vocabulary or at least be labeled as such, but the provided text is Mandarin.

Correct translation (in Hakka Latin script):
"Fut-bî mó̤ siû"

(Note: Hakka commonly uses Han characters with regional variants, but the translation should at least differ from standard Mandarin.)

The translation is in Chinese, not Hakka ('hak'). It simply copies the content in standard written Chinese.

Correct translation (example in Hakka; note: Hakka language is rarely written, and there is no standardized orthography, but here is an approximation using Chinese characters and Hakka-style expressions for educational purposes):
启动/交付数据库事务出错，导致钱包交易移除个过程失败。

If a more authentic Hakka Romanization is preferred:
Choih-tung/kiu-hap tú-sṳ-khò tsṳ-yong chhut-ho, tó-hak ngien-pau tsiòng-ngī chuk-sip sêu-pai.

But the above is generally increased Chinese readability in the absence of a standardized Hakka written form.

修剪：最後一次钱包同步超過修剪後个資料。你需要用 -reindex（若係修剪節點，著重新下載完整區塊鏈）

If localized in Hakka Han characters (close to Cantonese/Hakka-influenced written Chinese):

修剪：最後一次錢包同步超過修剪後資料。你需要 -reindex（修剪節點需要重新下載全部區塊鏈）

However, please note that standardized written Hakka is rare and Chinese is most widely used in writing; true Hakka localization would more likely be in Romanized or Han-character Hakka.

The translation is problematic. In the Hak (Hakka) string, the format specifier %s is placed at the beginning, and the colon ":" is at the end, which is inconsistent with the English sentence. The translation is also very close to Chinese, not Hakka, and may not be a proper Hakka localization. There is a possibility that this is simply a Mandarin Chinese translation.

Correct translation (if using Hakka script/romanization, but since there's no standard Hakka writing, a common way is to use Hakka Pinyin or local Hakka expressions; for illustrative purposes, here's a possible romanized version):
移除交易失敗: %s

If correct Hakka script is not available, it is better to clarify with native speakers. The provided translation is not proper Hakka.
