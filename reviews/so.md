# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>Xaq-click si aad cinwaanka edit ama qoraalka</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is understandable but contains several issues:
- "Xaq-click" uses an English/Somali hybrid form; the correct Somali word for "right" is "midig."
- The format "edit address or label" is not properly rendered; "edit" should be translated.
- There is some awkward phrasing, and the format is not natural or standard for Somali.
- It is missing correct translation for "label" ("qoraal" can suffice but "sumad" might be more suitable).
- The word order and spacing are acceptable.

Correct translation:
Midig-guji si aad u tafatirto cinwaanka ama sumadda
```

The translation is incomplete and ungrammatical. The Somali translation cuts off at "si ay u", which does not complete the sentence. Additionally, "lacagta qadaadiicda ah" is a literal translation of "the money of coins/coins' money", but "qadaadiic" suffices for "coins" in Somali.

Correct translation:

The translation is problematic.

ERR
There is an unnecessary space between "Nuqul" and "Label". Somali ("so") language does not require this spacing, and keeping it introduces a formatting error. Furthermore, "Nuqul" is the correct term for "Copy", and "Label" can be left as is if there is no established Somali term; however, to avoid code mixing, "Label" could optionally be translated as "Sumad" (meaning "label" or "mark").

Correct translation:
Nuqul Label
or, for a more Somali wording:
Nuqul Sumad

The translation "Comma kala file" is incorrect in Somali, and does not accurately translate "Comma separated file". "Kala" by itself means "separate" but the phrase does not make sense as written.

The translation "Ku celi passphrase cusub" literally means "Repeat new passphrase," but the construction is awkward in Somali. "Ku celi" means "repeat," but contextually for "Repeat new passphrase" (as in prompting the user to re-enter their new passphrase), a clearer Somali translation would be:

Correct translation:

Fur boorsada
(Depending on preferred terminology for "wallet" in the Bitcoin context. "Boorsada" is also commonly used for wallet/purse in Somali. "Fur" means "unlock/open".)

There are issues with repetition ("jeebka jeebkaaga" meaning "your wallet your wallet"), awkward phrasing, and the translation does not fully preserve the original meaning and emphasis. The translation also lacks proper spacing and natural word order in Somali, particularly around the bold warning. Format specifiers are not an issue here, but the syntax and capitalisation do not follow the source's intention.

Correct translation:

The translation is inaccurate and ungrammatical.

ERR
The translation is inaccurate and incomplete. Several elements are missing, such as the words "words" and there is poor handling of spacing around tags and format. The phrase "characters random" should be "xarfo aan la isku xirin". Also, "jeebka" is a literal translation of "wallet" but "jeebka" means "pocket" in Somali, while "wallet" as a crypto wallet should be "boorsada" or "kaydiska" to avoid confusion. "passphrase" should be localized or quoted if no Somali equivalent. Also, missing is the full sentence structure and proper linkage.

Correct translation:
Geli erayga sirta cusub ee boorsada.&lt;br/&gt;Fadlan isticmaal &lt;b&gt;toban ama in ka badan xarfo aan la isku xirin&lt;/b&gt;, ama &lt;b&gt;sideed ama in ka badan erayo&lt;/b&gt; oo kala duwan.

The translation is problematic for the following reasons:
- It awkwardly mixes Somali and English (“encrypting”, "by", "bitcoins") rather than using Somali equivalents.
- The phrase "furin qaadsiinaya" is an unclear or incorrect attempt at 'malware infecting'.
- Sentence structure is not natural in Somali.
- There are stray spaces ("ka xado by furin").
- The translation is inaccurate and unclear for Somali speakers.

ERR  
The provided translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of the English source, which is about exporting data from the current tab into a file. The Somali text given roughly translates to "How to specialize the way of training", which is unrelated.  

Correct translation:
