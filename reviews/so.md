```
        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>Xaq-click si aad cinwaanka edit ama qoraalka</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incomplete and partially incorrect. The English phrase "Right-click to edit address or label" means performing a right-click action to edit either the address or label. The current translation says "Xaq-click si aad cinwaanka edit ama qoraalka," where "edit" is left untranslated and grammar is not fully correct in Somali ('so'). Also, "Right-click" should be translated properly, and the structure should reflect Somali grammatical norms.

A better translation would be:  
"Guji midig si aad u tafatirto cinwaanka ama summada"
```

```
        <source>New</source>
        <translation>Hormarin</translation>
    
YES  
The Somali translation for "New" is incorrect. The provided translation "Hormarin" appears to be a misspelling or inaccurate. The correct Somali word for "New" is "Cusub".

Correct translation:  
<translation>Cusub</translation>
```

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>CLose</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains a case error and is not in Somali ('so'). The correct Somali translation for "Close" (as in a button to close a window) is "Xir". 

Correct translation:
Xir
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Sida loo tababbardhigo qaabka loo takhasusay</translation>
    
YES  
The translation does not reflect the original English meaning and appears unrelated. The correct translation in Somali ('so') for "Export the data in the current tab to a file" would be:  
"Dhoofinta xogta ku jirta tabka hadda jirta una dhoofiso fayl"
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation> Dhoofinta</translation>
    
YES  
There is an extra leading space before the word "Dhoofinta" in the translation, which is a whitespace formatting issue. The translation should not have leading or trailing spaces.

Correct translation:  
Dhoofinta
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Dooro cinwaanka u dirto lacagta qadaadiicda ah si ay u</translation>
    
YES  
The word order in the Somali translation is incorrect and the sentence is incomplete or awkward. A correct translation of "Choose the address to send coins to" should be:  
"Dooro cinwaanka lacagta qadaadiicda loo diro"
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Dooro cinwaanka si aad u hesho lacagta qadaadiicda leh</translation>
    
YES  
The translation given is in Somali, which corresponds to the language code 'so', so the language is correct. However, the provided translation is more a literal Somali phrase meaning "Choose the address so that you can receive the money with coins," which is understandable but somewhat awkward and not fully corresponding to a natural translation in the Bitcoin context.

A better translation would more clearly reflect the context of choosing a Bitcoin address to receive coins, ensuring clarity and flow in Somali. For example:  
"Dooro cinwaanka lagu heli doono qadaadiicda"  
or  
"Dooro cinwaanka lagu qaadan doono qadaadiicda"

Therefore, the original translation is somewhat inaccurate or unnatural for the Bitcoin context.

Correct translation:  
Dooro cinwaanka lagu heli doono qadaadiicda
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>CAagga</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "CAagga" contains inappropriate capitalization and looks incorrect for the Somali language ('so'). The correct translation for "Choose" in Somali is "Doorto".
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</source>
        <translation>Kuwani waa cinwaanada Seeraar in aad ku direyso lacagaha. Marwalba waxaa ka mid ah masuuliyiinta kubadda cagta ah ee hubinaya in ay ka soo horjeedaan tacaddiyadeeda, taas oo ay ku tallaabsato in ay ka qayb qaataan isbedelka taleemooyinka.</translation>
    
YES
The translation does not correspond to the source text and introduces unrelated content about football officials and protests, which is incorrect and irrelevant. The original message is about Bitcoin addresses and signing limitations, but the translation talks about something entirely different.

Correct translation:
Kuwani waa cinwaanadaaga Bitcoin ee aad ku heli karto lacagaha. Isticmaal batoonka 'Abuur cinwaan cusub oo lagu helo' ee tabka helitaanka si aad u abuurto cinwaanada cusub.
Saxiixidda waxaa kaliya suurtagal ah cinwaanada nooca 'legacy'.
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation> Nuqul Kabaha Cinwaanka</translation>
    
YES  
There is an extra leading space before "Nuqul" which causes a whitespace formatting issue. The word "Kabaha" is incorrect in the context of Bitcoin "address." The correct term for "address" in Somali, especially in the Bitcoin context, is "Cinwaanka." The word "Nuqul" means "Copy," so it should be combined without extra spacing and with the correct words.

Correct translation:  
<translation>Nuqul Cinwaanka</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Nuqul  Label</translation>
    
YES
There is an extra space before "Label" in the translation which is inconsistent with the source text. The correct translation should remove the extra space for proper formatting.

Correct translation:
Nuqul Label
```

```
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>Comma kala file</translation>
    
YES
The translation is not accurate. The English term "Comma separated file" refers to a file format where fields are separated by commas, commonly called "CSV" (Comma-Separated Values). The provided translation "Comma kala file" is a mix of English and an incorrect word "kala" which does not mean "separated" in Somali. 

A better translation in Somali would be:
"Fayl kala soocan oo leh faasiqadaha" 
or more simply,
"Fayl isku kala soocan oo leh faasiqado" 
which means "File separated by commas."

Correct translation:
Fayl isku kala soocan oo leh faasiqado
```

```
        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>Waxaa jiray qalad isku dayaya in uu badbaadiyo liiska cinwaanka si. %1Iskuday mar kale.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains grammatical errors and formatting issues:  
- The phrase "isku dayaya in uu badbaadiyo" (trying to save) is awkward and incomplete in this context.  
- The punctuation and spacing are incorrect: "%1Iskuday" lacks space after %1 and "si." is incomplete and misplaced.  
- The phrase "liiska cinwaanka si." is unnatural and incomplete; "to %1" should be clearly linked.  
- The polite request "Please try again." is translated as "Iskuday mar kale." which is acceptable but needs proper spacing.

Corrected translation:  
Waxaa jiray qalad markii la isku dayay in liiska cinwaannada lagu kaydiyo %1. Fadlan mar kale isku day.
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>Cinwaanada diraya%1</translation>
    
YES  
The translation merges the words without proper spacing and uses an incorrect form for "sending addresses." The correct translation in Somali should keep a space before the placeholder "%1" and use the proper term for "sending" and "addresses." A better translation would be:

Cinwaanada diraya - %1
```

```
        <source>Enter passphrase</source>
        <translation>Gali Passphrase</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Gali Passphrase" is partially correct but not fully appropriate. In Somali, "Enter" is commonly translated as "Geli" rather than "Gali". Also, "Passphrase" is an English word that may be better translated or left as is depending on context. However, the usual practice is to retain "passphrase" given its technical nature, or provide an explanatory word.

Correct translation:
Geli passphrase
```

```
        <source>Repeat new passphrase</source>
        <translation>Ku celi passphrase cusub</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes Somali ('Ku celi passphrase cusub') with an untranslated English word 'passphrase'. The English phrase "Repeat new passphrase" should be fully translated into Somali for consistency and clarity, especially in a technical context like Bitcoin.

Correct translation:  
"Ku celi erayga sirta ah ee cusub"
```

```
        <source>Encrypt wallet</source>
        <translation>jeebka Encrypt</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic because it mixes English and Somali improperly. "Encrypt wallet" in Somali should be fully translated and natural. The word "jeebka" means "the wallet" and should precede the verb. The verb "encrypt" can be translated as "sirta" or "iska sir", meaning "to encrypt" or "make secret."  

Correct translation:  
"Jeebka sirta"  
or more natural imperative:  
"Jeebka isku sir"
```

```
        <source>Unlock wallet</source>
        <translation>jeebka Unlock</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. The English phrase "Unlock wallet" is translated as "jeebka Unlock," which mixes a Somali word "jeebka" (meaning "the pocket") with the English word "Unlock" untranslated. This is inconsistent and incorrect as the whole phrase should be translated properly into Somali without retaining English words.  

Correct translation:  
"Fur jeebka"  
(meaning "Unlock the wallet," with "jeebka" used commonly for "wallet" in Somali and "Fur" meaning "Unlock"/"Open")
```

```
        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Digniin: Haddii aad jeebka jeebkaaga qarisid, Oo aad lumiso ereygii,Adigaa sameyn doontaa&lt;b&gt;Lumin oo dhan BITCOINS AAD&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has issues with grammar, punctuation, and spacing. "jeebka jeebkaaga" is repetitive and awkward; "ereygii" is vague and should be more clearly "furaha sirta" (passphrase). The phrasing "Adigaa sameyn doontaa" is incorrect and unnatural here. The emphasis tags (&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;) should have a space before them to separate from the previous word.

Correct translation:  
Digniin: Haddii aad jeebkaaga qariso oo aad lumiso furaha sirta, waxaad &lt;b&gt;LUMIN DOONTAA DHAMMAAN BITCOINS-KAAGA&lt;/b&gt;!
```

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?</source>
        <translation>Ma hubtaa in aad jeceshahay in aad jeebka sirta?</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and awkward in Somali. "Ma hubtaa" means "Are you sure," but "in aad jeceshahay in aad jeebka sirta?" literally translates to "that you want to your pocket the secret?" which is not proper Somali and does not convey "encrypt your wallet."

Correct translation:
Ma hubtaa inaad jeebkaaga sir geliso?
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>
        <translation>Ku qor passrase cusub jeebka.&lt;br/&gt;Fadlan isticmaal ereygii passphrase ah &lt;b&gt;toban ama in ka badan characters random&lt;/b&gt;ama&lt;b&gt;sideed ama kabadan&lt;/b&gt;.</translation>
    
YES
The translation has multiple issues: "passrase" is a typo for "passphrase"; the phrase "characters random" should be reordered as "characters random ah" or ideally translated properly; the conjunction "ama" ("or") lacks spaces around it; and "sideed ama kabadan" (eight or more) is incomplete and missing the noun, e.g. "words".

Correct translation:
Ku qor erayga sirta cusub ee jeebka.&lt;br/&gt;Fadlan isticmaal eray sir ah &lt;b&gt;toban ama in ka badan oo xarafyo kala duwan ah&lt;/b&gt; ama &lt;b&gt;sideed ama in ka badan oo erayo ah&lt;/b&gt;.
```

```
        <source>Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet.</source>
        <translation>sideed ula kacsan ama kabadan</translation>
    
YES  
The translation provided does not accurately represent the source sentence and is incomplete or nonsensical in Somali ('so'). The source text instructs the user to "Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet." The translation should mention entering both the old and new passphrases related to the wallet.

Correct translation:  
"Geli erayga sirta ah ee hore iyo erayga sirta ah ee cusub ee boorsada."
```

```
        <source>Remember that encrypting your wallet cannot fully protect your bitcoins from being stolen by malware infecting your computer.</source>
        <translation>Xusuusnow in encrypting jeebka si buuxda ma uu ilaalin karo bitcoins aad ka xado by furin qaadsiinaya aad computer.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a mixture of English and Somali words and is grammatically incorrect. For example, "encrypting" and "wallet" are left in English, and phrases like "si buuxda ma uu ilaalin karo" are unidiomatic. Also, "by furin qaadsiinaya aad computer" is nonsensical and mixes languages improperly.

Correct translation:  
Xusuusnow in sirgelinta jeebkaaga aysan si buuxda u ilaalin karin bitcoins-kaaga inay xadaan haddii malware uu ku soo galo kombiyuutarkaaga.
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Jeebka in la encrypted</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incorrect. "Jeebka in la encrypted" is not grammatically correct in Somali ("so"). The phrase should clearly convey "Wallet to be encrypted" meaning a wallet that needs encryption. A better translation would be:  
"Jeebka in la qariyo" or "Jeebka la qarinayo" (meaning "Wallet to be encrypted").  

Correct translation:  
Jeebka in la qarinayo
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Jeebka in aan la xarriiqin</translation>
    
YES
The translation misses conveying the future action "is about to be encrypted" and is a fragment meaning roughly "Your wallet will not be encrypted" or "Your wallet is not to be encrypted," which changes the meaning. The source implies an imminent encryption event, which should be clearly expressed in Somali.

Correct translation:
Jeebkaaga waa inuu hadda la sirgaliyaa
```

```
        <source>The supplied passphrases do not match.</source>
        <translation>Supplied passrases ma u dhigma.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incomplete and contains a misspelling ("passrases" instead of "passphrases"). It also does not convey the full meaning "The supplied passphrases do not match."  

Correct translation:  
"Furahaarayada la siiyay ma is waafaqaan."
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>Passrase soo galay for decryption jeebka ahaa mid khaldan.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes English and Somali improperly ("Passrase soo galay for decryption jeebka ahaa mid khaldan"). It should be fully in Somali and properly structured. Also, "passphrase" should be translated or adapted correctly, and "wallet" ("jeebka") should be integrated smoothly.

Correct translation:  
"Furaha sirta ah ee loo galay furfuridda jeebka ayaa ahaa mid khaldan."
```

```
        <source>Warning: The Caps Lock key is on!</source>
        <translation>Digniin: Furaha Lock Caps waa on!</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains errors and unnatural phrasing. "Digniin" is incorrect; the correct Somali word for "Warning" is "Digniin" but the spelling is slightly off or may cause confusion with "Digniin". Also, "Furaha Lock Caps" mixes English and Somali unnecessarily. "Caps Lock" is often transliterated or translated as "Furaha Caps Lock" or "Furaha xarafka weyn" to convey the meaning.

A better translation would be:  
"Digniin: Furaha Caps Lock waa shidan yahay!"
```

```
        <source>Settings file %1 might be corrupt or invalid.</source>
        <translation>Settings file,%1waxaa laga yaabaa in musuqmaasuq ama aan asal ahayn.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has spacing and punctuation issues, as there's no space after the comma and before %1. Also, "musuqmaasuq" typically means "corruption" in a political or moral sense, not "corrupt" as in a file being corrupted. A better choice would be "xumo" or "waxyeello" to refer to a corrupted file. The phrase "aan asal ahayn" is somewhat vague; "aan sax ahayn" (not correct/valid) is clearer.  

Correct translation:  
"Faylka dejinta %1 waxaa laga yaabaa inuu xumoobay ama aanu sax ahayn."
```

```
        <source>An internal error occurred. %1 will attempt to continue safely. This is an unexpected bug which can be reported as described below.</source>
        <translation>Qalad gudaha ah ayaa dhacay.%1isku dayi doonaan in ay si ammaan ah u sii socdaan. Kani waa cayil aan la filayn oo la soo sheegi karo sida hoos ku xusan.</translation>
    
YES
There are spacing issues and some wording awkwardness in the translation:
- There should be a space after the period in "dhacay.%1".
- "%1" refers to a singular entity ("will attempt"), so the verb following it should be singular: "isku dayi doonaa" instead of "isku dayi doonaan".
- "cayil" means "fat" or "obesity," which is incorrect for "bug." The correct term is "cilad".
- "sii socdaan" ("to continue") is better expressed as "sii wadi doono" for "will attempt to continue."
- "an internal error occurred" = "Qalad gudaha ah ayaa dhacay" is acceptable but could better flow as "Waxaa dhacay qalad gudaha ah."

Correct translation:
"Waxaa dhacay qalad gudaha ah. %1 isku dayi doonaa in ay si ammaan ah u sii wado. Kani waa cilad aan la filayn oo la soo sheegi karo sida hoos ku xusan."
```

```
        <source>Do you want to reset settings to default values, or to abort without making changes?</source>
        <extracomment>Explanatory text shown on startup when the settings file cannot be read. Prompts user to make a choice between resetting or aborting.</extracomment>
        <translation>Ma waxaad doonaysaa in aad dib u dejiso goobaha si aad u default qiyamka, ama aad iska xaaqdo adigoon isbeddelin?</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is partly understandable but contains awkward phrasing and some erroneous word order, diminishing clarity and naturalness in Somali. In particular, "si aad u default qiyamka" is incorrect and unnatural; "default" should be translated or integrated properly, and "qiyamka" (values) should precede "default" if used as a loanword or be fully translated. Also, "iska xaaqdo" is not an appropriate verb here for "abort." A better verb would be "joojiso" (stop/abort) or "ka laabato" (cancel).  

Correct translation:  
"Ma waxaad rabtaa inaad dib u dejiso goobaha qiimayaashii asalka ahaa, ama inaad joojiso adigoon wax isbeddel ah samayn?"
```

```
        <source>A fatal error occurred. Check that settings file is writable, or try running with -nosettings.</source>
        <extracomment>Explanatory text shown on startup when the settings file could not be written. Prompts user to check that we have the ability to write to the file. Explains that the user has the option of running without a settings file.</extracomment>
        <translation>Waxaa dhacday qalad dilaa ah. Hubi in file settings waa writable, ama isku day inaad la -nosettings socda.</translation>
    
YES
The translation mixes English and Somali improperly, using untranslated words such as "file settings," "writable," and the phrase "isku day inaad la -nosettings socda" is awkward and incorrect. The phrase "-nosettings" should be kept as is, but integrated naturally into the Somali sentence. A better translation that is fully in Somali and maintains the technical terms would be:

"Waxaa dhacay qalad halis ah. Hubi in faylka dejinta (settings) la qori karo, ama isku day inaad ku socodsiiso -nosettings."
```

```
        <source>Transactions</source>
        <translation>Transaction-yada</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Transaction-yada" is incorrect and inappropriate for Somali ('so'). It appears to be a mix of English and possibly incorrect suffixes, not a proper Somali word.

Correct translation:  
"Xawaaladaha"
```

```
        <source>Browse transaction history</source>
        <translation>Baadh taariikhda transaction-yada</translation>
    
YES  
The word "transaction-yada" is a mix of English and Somali suffix "-yada," which is not standard or correct usage. A more appropriate Somali translation for "transaction" is "hawlgal" or "macnaamil" depending on context. Also, "Baadh" means "search" rather than "browse," which might be acceptable but "Daawo" (view) or "Soo bandhig" (display) could be better choices for "browse."  

Correct translation:  
Baadh taariikhda macaamilada
```

```
        <source>Exit</source>
        <translation>ka bax</translation>
    
YES  
The provided Somali translation "ka bax" is correct for "Exit." However, it should be capitalized as "Ka bax" because it is a standalone command or button label. Also, there is no need for additional words or changes; simply capitalizing the first letter is sufficient.  

Correct translation:  
Ka bax
```

```
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>Comma kala file</translation>
    
YES
The translation is not accurate. The English term "Comma separated file" refers to a file format where fields are separated by commas, commonly called "CSV" (Comma-Separated Values). The provided translation "Comma kala file" is a mix of English and an incorrect word "kala" which does not mean "separated" in Somali. 

A better translation in Somali would be:
"Fayl kala soocan oo leh faasiqadaha" 
or more simply,
"Fayl isku kala soocan oo leh faasiqado" 
which means "File separated by commas."

Correct translation:
Fayl isku kala soocan oo leh faasiqado
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation> Dhoofinta</translation>
    
YES  
There is an extra leading space before the word "Dhoofinta" in the translation, which is a whitespace formatting issue. The translation should not have leading or trailing spaces.

Correct translation:  
Dhoofinta
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Sida loo tababbardhigo qaabka loo takhasusay</translation>
    
YES  
The translation does not reflect the original English meaning and appears unrelated. The correct translation in Somali ('so') for "Export the data in the current tab to a file" would be:  
"Dhoofinta xogta ku jirta tabka hadda jirta una dhoofiso fayl"
```
