```
        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>Xaq-click si aad cinwaanka edit ama qoraalka</translation>
    
YES - The Somali translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the English source text. The word "edit" is not correctly translated, and the sentence structure is awkward.

Correct translation: Midig-guji si aad u tafatirto ciwaanka ama calaamadda
```

```
        <source>New</source>
        <translation>Hormarin</translation>
    
YES: The translation of "New" to "Hormarin" is incorrect and likely an accidental or nonsensical substitution. The context of Bitcoin does not suggest any known term that translates to "Hormarin".
Correct translation: Novi
```

```
        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>Nuqul ka dhig cinwaanka hadda la soo xulay ee clipboard system</translation>
    
YES - The Somali translation is grammatically incorrect and does not accurately convey the meaning of the English source text. The phrase "Nuqul ka dhig cinwaanka hadda la soo xulay ee clipboard system" translates roughly to "Make a copy of the currently selected address for the system clipboard," which is awkward and doesn't sound natural.

A more accurate and natural translation would be:

"Nuqul ka dhig ciwaanka hadda la doortay ee kumbiyuutarka"

This translates to "Copy the currently selected address to the computer's clipboard."
```

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>CLose</translation>
    
YES. The translation has an unnecessary uppercase 'C' at the beginning of the word.
CLose
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Sida loo tababbardhigo qaabka loo takhasusay</translation>
    
YES. The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text is about exporting data from the current tab to a file, while the translation appears to be about specialized training or expertise, which is completely unrelated.

Correct translation: Soo daji xogta tabka hadda ku jira fayl</translation>
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation> Dhoofinta</translation>
    
YES, There is a leading space in the translation. The correct translation is "Dhoofinta".
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>Naxashka</translation>
    
YES. The translation is inaccurate. The word "Delete" means to remove or erase something. "Naxashka" in Somali means "drawing". A more appropriate translation for "Delete" in the context of Bitcoin or general computing would be "Tirtir".

YES. The translation is inaccurate. "Naxashka" means "drawing". The correct translation for "Delete" is "Tirtir".
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Dooro cinwaanka u dirto lacagta qadaadiicda ah si ay u</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and the meaning is distorted. The phrase "si ay u" at the end is incomplete and doesn't make sense in this context. It seems like an attempt to translate "to" but it's not used correctly.

Correct translation: Dooro cinwaanka aad doonayso inaad u dirto lacagta qadaadiicda ah
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Dooro cinwaanka si aad u hesho lacagta qadaadiicda leh</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and doesn't convey the intended meaning accurately. The phrase "lacagta qadaadiicda leh" is awkward and doesn't fit the context of receiving Bitcoin.

Correct translation: "Dooro cinwaanka si aad lacag ugu hesho"
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>CAagga</translation>
    
YES - The translation is nonsensical and does not convey the meaning of "Choose". The word "CAagga" is not a recognized word in any language.
Correct translation: Yadda
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Kuwani waa cinwaanada Seeraar aad ku direyso lacagaha. Marwalba caddadka ama cinwaanka laga soo hubiyo inta aadan dirin lacagta qadaadiicda ah ka hor inta aadan dirin.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic because it is not a valid translation to Somali and contains nonsensical phrases.

The correct translation should be:
"Kuwani waa cinwaanada Bitcoin ee aad ku direyso lacagaha. Marwalba eeg qaddarka iyo cinwaanka lagu dirayo ka hor inta aadan dirin lacagta."
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</source>
        <translation>Kuwani waa cinwaanada Seeraar in aad ku direyso lacagaha. Marwalba waxaa ka mid ah masuuliyiinta kubadda cagta ah ee hubinaya in ay ka soo horjeedaan tacaddiyadeeda, taas oo ay ku tallaabsato in ay ka qayb qaataan isbedelka taleemooyinka.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is completely nonsensical and has no relation to the original English text about Bitcoin addresses. It appears to be a random string of words.
Correct translation: Kuwani waa ciwaannadaada Bitcoin ee aad lacagaha ku heli karto. Waxaad isticmaali kartaa badhanka 'Abuur ciwaan cusub oo la helo' ee ku yaal tabka 'Hel' si aad u abuurto ciwaanno cusub. Saxiixidda waxaa kaliya lagu samayn karaa ciwaannada nooca 'legacy'.
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation> Nuqul Kabaha Cinwaanka</translation>
    
YES - The translation seems to be a mix of Somali and Arabic. "Nuqul" is Somali for "copy", and "Kabaha Cinwaanka" is likely Somali for "the address". However, the word "Cinwaanka" seems to be duplicated or there is an error. Given the context of Bitcoin, the translation should accurately convey "Copy Address". A more appropriate Somali translation would be "Nuqul Cinwaanka".

Nuqul Cinwaanka
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Nuqul  Label</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. "Nuqul" does not mean "Copy" in any recognizable language. The correct translation for "Copy Label" in a language like Spanish would be "Copiar Etiqueta". Since the target language is specified as 'so', and this appears to be an unknown or incorrectly specified language, the correct response is UNK_LANG.
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>Comma kala file</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. "Comma separated file" should be translated to "Comma separated file" in Samoan. The provided translation "Comma kala file" is not a correct translation.
NO
```

```
        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>Waxaa jiray qalad isku dayaya in uu badbaadiyo liiska cinwaanka si. %1Iskuday mar kale.</translation>
    
YES. The translation of the Somali text is incorrect and does not convey the original English meaning accurately. It also contains spacing issues.

Here's a breakdown:
- "Waxaa jiray qalad isku dayaya in uu badbaadiyo liiska cinwaanka si. %1Iskuday mar kale." translates to "There was an error trying to save the address list to. %1Try again."
- The phrase "si. %1" is grammatically incorrect and the intended meaning of "to %1" is lost.
- The spacing between "%1" and "Iskuday" is incorrect.

A more accurate translation would be:

"Waxaa jiray qalad isku dayaya in uu badbaadiyo liiska cinwaanka ee %1. Isku day mar kale."

This translates to: "There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Try again."
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>Cinwaanada diraya%1</translation>
    
YES - The translation is missing a space between the last word and the format specifier.
Cinwaanada diraya %1
```

```
        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Dhoofinta Fashilmeen</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "Dhoofinta Fashilmeen" is not the correct Somali translation for "Exporting Failed". The correct translation for "Exporting Failed" in Somali is "Dhoofinta ku fashilantay".

Dhoofinta ku fashilantay
```

```
        <source>Enter passphrase</source>
        <translation>Gali Passphrase</translation>
    
YES
The translation is grammatically incorrect and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The verb "Gali" is not a recognized word in any common language for "enter" or a related concept.

Correct translation: "Tsoka Passphrase"
```

```
        <source>Repeat new passphrase</source>
        <translation>Ku celi passphrase cusub</translation>
    
YES - The provided translation seems to be in a language other than "so". It translates "Repeat new passphrase" to "Ku celi passphrase cusub" which appears to be in Somali.
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Encrypt wallet</source>
        <translation>jeebka Encrypt</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical. The word "jeebka" is not a valid translation for "Encrypt" in any known language. The correct translation for "Encrypt wallet" into Russian (assuming "so" refers to Russian based on common translation contexts for technical terms) is "Зашифровать кошелек".
Зашифровать кошелек
```

```
        <source>This operation needs your wallet passphrase to unlock the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Hawlgalkani wuxuu u baahan yahay jeebkaaga Passphrase jeebka si loo furo jeebka.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic due to poor word choice and grammatical errors, making it difficult to understand. The term "jeebka" is repeated unnecessarily.

Correct translation: "Hawlgalkani wuxuu u baahan yahay furaha sirta ah ee jeebkaaga si loo furo jeebka."
```

```
        <source>Unlock wallet</source>
        <translation>jeebka Unlock</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because it includes an unrecognised word "jeebka" and it fails to translate the English word "Unlock". The context is Bitcoin, and the translation should be a relevant term in that context.

Correct translation: **Unlock wallet**
```

```
        <source>Confirm wallet encryption</source>
        <translation>Xaqiiji encryption jeebka</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "jeebka" which means "pocket" instead of "wallet". The correct translation for wallet in this context would be "boorsho".
Xaqiiji boorsho encryption
```

```
        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Digniin: Haddii aad jeebka jeebkaaga qarisid, Oo aad lumiso ereygii,Adigaa sameyn doontaa&lt;b&gt;Lumin oo dhan BITCOINS AAD&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>
    
YES - The translation is highly problematic and nonsensical. The Somali language is not correctly used, and the meaning is completely distorted.

Correct translation:
"Digniin: Haddii aad jeebkaaga siraynaysid oo aad lumisid erayga sirta ah, waxaad &lt;b&gt;LUMAYSAA BITCOIN-KAAGA OO DHAN&lt;/b&gt;!"
```

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?</source>
        <translation>Ma hubtaa in aad jeceshahay in aad jeebka sirta?</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of the source text. The word "jeebka" means "pocket" and "sirta" means "secret". The correct translation should be "Ma hubtaa inaad rabto inaad sirayso jeebkaaga?".

Ma hubtaa inaad rabto inaad sirayso jeebkaaga?
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>
        <translation>Ku qor passrase cusub jeebka.&lt;br/&gt;Fadlan isticmaal ereygii passphrase ah &lt;b&gt;toban ama in ka badan characters random&lt;/b&gt;ama&lt;b&gt;sideed ama kabadan&lt;/b&gt;.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is not accurate and the language is not "so". The language appears to be Somali.
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet.</source>
        <translation>sideed ula kacsan ama kabadan</translation>
    
YES - The translation is nonsensical and does not convey the meaning of the original English text. The provided translation appears to be in Somali, not 'so' as specified. The correct translation for "Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet." into Somali would be "Geli ereyga sirta ah ee duugga ah iyo ereyga sirta ah ee cusub ee jeebka."
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Remember that encrypting your wallet cannot fully protect your bitcoins from being stolen by malware infecting your computer.</source>
        <translation>Xusuusnow in encrypting jeebka si buuxda ma uu ilaalin karo bitcoins aad ka xado by furin qaadsiinaya aad computer.</translation>
    
YES: The translation provided uses an incorrect word for "wallet" and "malware".
Correct translation: "Xusuusnow in fur-furinta jeebkaaga aanay gebi ahaanba kaaga ilaalin karin bitcoins-kaaga in lagu xado fayras kumbuyuutarkaaga soo galay."
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Jeebka in la encrypted</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. The correct translation should be "Jeebka si loo qoro".
Jeebka in la encrypted
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Jeebka in aan la xarriiqin</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>IMPORTANT: Any previous backups you have made of your wallet file should be replaced with the newly generated, encrypted wallet file. For security reasons, previous backups of the unencrypted wallet file will become useless as soon as you start using the new, encrypted wallet.</source>

Sababo la xidhiidha amniga awgood, gurmadkii hore ee faylalka jeebka ee aan la gooyn ayaa noqon doona mid aan waxtar lahayn isla markaaba markaad bilowdo isticmaalka jeebka cusub ee la xarrimay.</translation>
    
YES: The translation contains a significant error in the word "xarrimay". The source text uses "encrypted", which translates to "la codeeyay" or "la siray" in Somali, not "xarrimay" which means "forbidden" or "prohibited".

MUHIIM AH: Wixii gurmad ah ee hore ee aad ka samaysay faylkaaga jeebka waa in lagugu beddelaa faylka jeebka ee dhowaan la abuuray, faylka jeebka la codeeyay. Sababo la xidhiidha amniga awgood, gurmadkii hore ee faylalka jeebka ee aan la codeyn ayaa noqon doona mid aan waxtar lahayn isla markaaba markaad bilowdo isticmaalka jeebka cusub ee la codeeyay.
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed</source>
        <translation>encryption jeebka ku guuldareystay</translation>
    
YES, the translation is incorrect. The word "jeebka" does not appear to be a valid Somali word and does not convey the meaning of "wallet".

NO
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Encryption jeebka way ku guuldareysteen qalad gudaha awgeed. Jeebkaaga lama sirtain.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses informal and inappropriate language ("jeebka" instead of a more formal term for wallet) and also contains what appears to be a misspelling or nonsensical word ("jeebka"). The word "sirtain" is also not a standard Somali word for encrypt or secure, and is likely a mistranslation or a fabricated term.

The correct translation should be: "Lacagtaada lama sirin sababtoo ah qalad gudaha ah ayaa dhacay. Waxaa lagugu guuldareystay inaad lacagtaada sirto."
```

```
        <source>The supplied passphrases do not match.</source>
        <translation>Supplied passrases ma u dhigma.</translation>
    
YES. The translation contains a misspelling in the word "passphrases" which is misspelled as "passrases". The correct translation should be: "Supplied passphrases ma u dhigma."
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>Passrase soo galay for decryption jeebka ahaa mid khaldan.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is not accurate and contains untranslatable words. The correct translation should be "Qallad tahay lambarka sirta ah ee ku jira furaha sanduuqa."
```

```
        <source>Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.</source>
        <translation>Jeebka passphrase ayaa si guul leh loo bedelay.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate. "Jeebka" means "wallet" in Somali, but the translation of "passphrase" as "passphrase" and "successfully changed" as "si guul leh loo bedelay" is incorrect. The correct translation should be "Jeebkaaga erayga sirta ah ayaa si guul leh loo bedelay."
```

```
        <source>Warning: The Caps Lock key is on!</source>
        <translation>Digniin: Furaha Lock Caps waa on!</translation>
    
YES, the translation is not accurate. The Somali translation for "Warning" is "Digniin", but "Furaha Lock Caps waa on!" does not accurately translate "The Caps Lock key is on!".

The correct translation should be:
Digniin: Furaha Caps Lock wuu shidan yahay!
```

```
        <source>Settings file %1 might be corrupt or invalid.</source>
        <translation>Settings file,%1waxaa laga yaabaa in musuqmaasuq ama aan asal ahayn.</translation>
    
YES - The translation appears to be in Somali and not the intended language 'so'. The phrase "%1waxaa laga yaabaa in musuqmaasuq ama aan asal ahayn" translates to "file %1 may be corrupt or invalid" in Somali. The correct translation in the intended language is missing.
```

```
        <source>A fatal error occurred. %1 can no longer continue safely and will quit.</source>
        <translation>Waxaa dhacday qalad dilaa ah. %1 mar dambe si ammaan ah uma sii socon karo oo wuu ka tagi doonaa.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "waxaa dhacday" which means "it happened" and should be "dhacday". Also, "mar dambe" translates to "anymore" and should be "ma sii".

Correct translation: Dhacday qalad dilaa ah. %1 ma sii wadi karo si ammaan ah oo wuu istaagi doonaa.
```

```
        <source>An internal error occurred. %1 will attempt to continue safely. This is an unexpected bug which can be reported as described below.</source>
        <translation>Qalad gudaha ah ayaa dhacay.%1isku dayi doonaan in ay si ammaan ah u sii socdaan. Kani waa cayil aan la filayn oo la soo sheegi karo sida hoos ku xusan.</translation>
    
YES - The translation contains erroneous content. The phrase "Qalad gudaha ah ayaa dhacay" translates to "An internal error occurred", but the rest of the translation is incorrect. The phrase "Qalad gudaha ah ayaa dhacay.%1isku dayi doonaan in ay si ammaan ah u sii socdaan. Kani waa cayil aan la filayn oo la soo sheegi karo sida hoos ku xusan." is a mix of correct and incorrect Somali, and the word "cayil" means "fat" or "obese" instead of "bug".

Correct translation: Qalad gudaha ah ayaa dhacay. %1 wuxuu isku dayi doonaa inuu si badbaado leh u sii wado. Tani waa bug aan la filayn oo la soo sheegi karo sida hoos lagu sheegay.
```

        <extracomment>Explanatory text shown on startup when the settings file cannot be read. Prompts user to make a choice between resetting or aborting.</extracomment>
        <translation>Ma waxaad doonaysaa in aad dib u dejiso goobaha si aad u default qiyamka, ama aad iska xaaqdo adigoon isbeddelin?</translation>
    
YES - The translation is nonsensical and does not convey the original meaning. The Somali language used is incorrect and appears to be a garbled mix of words.

Correct translation: Ma waxaad rabtaa inaad dib u dejiso goobaha qiimaha caadiga ah, ama aad iska joojiso adiga oo aan waxba ka beddelin?
```

```
        <source>A fatal error occurred. Check that settings file is writable, or try running with -nosettings.</source>
        <extracomment>Explanatory text shown on startup when the settings file could not be written. Prompts user to check that we have the ability to write to the file. Explains that the user has the option of running without a settings file.</extracomment>
        <translation>Waxaa dhacday qalad dilaa ah. Hubi in file settings waa writable, ama isku day inaad la -nosettings socda.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is mostly accurate but uses an English word "writable" directly in the Somali sentence. It should be translated to a Somali equivalent.
Correct translation: Waxaa dhacday qalad dilaa ah. Hubi in file-ka dejimaha la qori karo, ama isku day inaad la -nosettings socodsiiso.
```

```
        <source>Error: %1</source>
        <translation>Khalad: %1</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses "Khalad" which is not a valid word in any language that resembles error. The correct translation for error in Arabic is "خطأ".
Khalad: %1
خطأ: %1
```

```
        <source>Overview</source>
        <translation>Dulmar</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. "Dulmar" has no relation to an overview.
Correct translation: "Resumen" or "General"
```

```
        <source>Transactions</source>
        <translation>Transaction-yada</translation>
    
YES, The translation "Transaction-yada" is nonsensical and likely a placeholder or error, not a correct translation of "Transactions" in any meaningful context, especially Bitcoin.
Correct translation: Transactions
```

```
        <source>Browse transaction history</source>
        <translation>Baadh taariikhda transaction-yada</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses the English word "transaction" instead of translating it to Somali.
Baadh taariikhda macaamilka
```

```
        <source>Exit</source>
        <translation>ka bax</translation>
    
YES
The translation is nonsensical and doesn't convey the meaning of "Exit" in the context of Bitcoin.
Correct translation: "Exit" should be translated to "Exit" or a context-appropriate term if a specific UI element or function is implied. Without further context on the specific function of "Exit" in the Bitcoin interface, a direct transliteration is most appropriate. However, if "ka bax" is indeed a word in the target language 'so', it doesn't seem to relate to the concept of exiting.
Let's assume 'so' refers to the Somali language. In Somali, "Exit" would be "Ka bax" or "Soo bax" depending on the context. The provided translation "ka bax" is indeed "Exit" in Somali, meaning to go out or leave. Therefore, the translation is accurate in the Somali language.

NO

        <source>Error: %1</source>
        <translation>Khalad: %1</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses "Khalad" which is not a valid word in any language that resembles error. The correct translation for error in Arabic is "خطأ".
Khalad: %1

        <translation>Comma kala file</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. "Comma separated file" should be translated to "Comma separated file" in Samoan. The provided translation "Comma kala file" is not a correct translation.
NO
```

```
        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Dhoofinta Fashilmeen</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "Dhoofinta Fashilmeen" is not the correct Somali translation for "Exporting Failed". The correct translation for "Exporting Failed" in Somali is "Dhoofinta ku fashilantay".

Dhoofinta ku fashilantay
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation> Dhoofinta</translation>
    
YES, There is a leading space in the translation. The correct translation is "Dhoofinta".

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Sida loo tababbardhigo qaabka loo takhasusay</translation>
    
YES. The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text is about exporting data from the current tab to a file, while the translation appears to be about specialized training or expertise, which is completely unrelated.

Correct translation: Soo daji xogta tabka hadda ku jira fayl</translation>
