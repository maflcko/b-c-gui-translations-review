# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>शिक्का कॉपी करा</translation>
    
YES - The translation for "Copy Label" is incorrect. The Marathi word "शिक्का" means "coin" or "stamp," which is not relevant to the context of copying a label in Bitcoin. The correct translation should be "लेबल कॉपी करा".

शिक्का कॉपी करा
```

```
        <source>Sign message…</source>
        <translation>स्वाक्षरी आणि संदेश...</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "स्वाक्षरी आणि संदेश" means "Signature and message" in English. The source text "Sign message…" translates to "संदेशावर स्वाक्षरी करा…" in Marathi.

Here's the corrected translation:
संदेशावर स्वाक्षरी करा…
```
