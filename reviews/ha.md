        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>Kwafi adireshin da aka zaɓa a halin yanzu domin yin amfani dashi</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The word "kwafi" is not a Hausa word for copy. "Kwafi" means copy in English. The correct word in Hausa is " kwafa". The phrase "domin yin amfani dashi" means "to use it", which is not appropriate for this context. The phrase should be "zuwa allo na kwamfuta" which means "to the computer screen".

Correct translation: Kwafa adireshin da aka zaɓa a halin yanzu zuwa allo na kwamfuta
```

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>Cɓatar</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The ha language is not a recognized language. The translation "Cɓatar" is likely a misspelling or an attempt to create a new word. There is no appropriate translation in ha for "Close" as the language is not recognized.

        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>Share adireshin da aka zaɓa a halin yanzu daga jerin </translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate. The word "Share" is used instead of "Delete". The correct translation should be "Share adireshin da aka zaɓa a halin yanzu daga jerin".
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation> Fitarwa</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The Hausa word for "Export" is "Fitadawa" and not "Fitarwa".

YES, The translation is inaccurate. The Hausa word for "Export" is "Fitadawa" and not "Fitarwa".
<source>Export</source>
<translation> Fitadawa</translation>
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>Sharewa</translation>
    
YES - The translation "Sharewa" is incorrect. The Hausa word for "Delete" is "Fada".
NO - The translation "Sharewa" is incorrect. The Hausa word for "Delete" is "Fada".
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Zaɓi adireshin don karɓar kuɗi internet da shi</translation>
    
YES - The translation is problematic because "kuɗi internet" is not the correct or natural way to refer to Bitcoin in Hausa. It literally translates to "internet money," which is too broad and doesn't convey the specific meaning of Bitcoin.

Correct translation: Zaɓi adireshin da za a karɓi kuɗi da shi
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>czaɓi</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Choose".
Correct translation: Sarai
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Waɗannan adiresoshin Bitcoin ne don tura kuɗi bitcoin . ka tabbatar da cewa adreshin daidai ne kamin ka tura abua a ciki</translation>
    
YES. The translation is inaccurate and contains grammatical errors and an irrelevant phrase. The phrase "kuɗi bitcoin" is redundant as "Bitcoin addresses" already implies Bitcoin. The grammar is also incorrect, making the sentence difficult to understand.

Correct translation: Waɗannan su ne adireshin Bitcoin ɗinka don aika kuɗi. Koyaushe duba adadin da adireshin da za a karɓa kafin a aika kuɗin.
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</source>
        <translation>Waɗannan adiresoshin Bitcoin ne don karɓar kuɗi. Yi amfani da maɓallin 'Ƙirƙiri sabon adireshin karɓa' a cikin shafin karɓa don ƙirƙirar sababbin adireshi.
zaka iya shiga ne kawai da adiresoshin 'na musamman' kawai.</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses the word "na musamman" which translates to "special" or "private". This is an incorrect translation of "legacy" in the context of Bitcoin addresses. The correct translation should refer to the original or older type of Bitcoin address.

Correct translation:
Waɗannan adiresoshin Bitcoin ne don karɓar kuɗi. Yi amfani da maɓallin 'Ƙirƙiri sabon adireshin karɓa' a cikin shafin karɓa don ƙirƙirar sababbin adireshi.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Kwafi  Lakabi</translation>
    
YES: The translation contains an extra space between "Kwafi" and "Lakabi". The correct translation should be "Kwafi Lakabi".
```

```
        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>An sami kuskure wajen ƙoƙarin ajiye jerin adireshi zuwa %1. Da fatan za a sake gwadawa. </translation>
    
YES, The translation has an extra space at the end of the sentence.
An sami kuskure wajen ƙoƙarin ajiye jerin adireshi zuwa %1. Da fatan za a sake gwadawa.
```

```
        <source>Repeat new passphrase</source>
        <translation>maimaita sabuwar kalmar sirri</translation>
    
YES, The translation is too literal and awkward in Hausa. A more natural translation would be: YES, The translation is too literal and awkward in Hausa. A more natural translation would be: "Maimaita sabon kalmar sirri"
```

```
        <source>Show passphrase</source>
        <translation>nuna kalmar sirri</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses the word "kalmar" which means "word" in Hausa, whereas the source text "passphrase" refers to a phrase or a sequence of words used for authentication. Therefore, the translation is inaccurate as it only translates "pass" as "kalmar" and omits "phrase".

The correct translation should be: "nuna jimlar kalmomi"
```

```
        <source>Encrypt wallet</source>
        <translation>sakaye walet</translation>
    
YES. The translation is not accurate and is problematic because "sakaye" is not the correct Hausa word for "encrypt." The correct translation should convey the meaning of encrypting a wallet.

The correct translation for "Encrypt wallet" in Hausa is: **"rufe walet"** or **"boye walet"**.
```

```
        <source>This operation needs your wallet passphrase to unlock the wallet.</source>
        <translation>abunda ake son yi na buƙatan laƙabin sirri domin buɗe walet</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and misses key parts of the original English text. The word "passphrase" is translated as "laƙabin sirri" (secret nickname), which is not the correct term for a wallet passphrase. Additionally, the phrase "unlock the wallet" is not accurately conveyed.

Correct translation: Wannan aikin yana buƙatar kalmar sirri ta walat ɗinka don buɗe walat ɗin.
```

```
        <source>Unlock wallet</source>
        <translation>Bude Walet</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and potentially problematic. "Bude Walet" does not accurately translate "Unlock wallet" into any recognizable language.
The correct translation for "Unlock wallet" in Hausa is: **Bude Walat**
```

```
        <source>Change passphrase</source>
        <translation>canza laƙabin sirri</translation>
    
YES, The word "passphrase" should be translated as "kalmar sirri" or "kalmar kariya" rather than "laƙabin sirri" which means "nickname".
"canza kalmar sirri"
```

```
        <source>Confirm wallet encryption</source>
        <translation>tabbar da an sakaye walet</translation>
    
YES - The translation appears to be a mistranslation and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The Hausa phrase "tabbar da an sakaye walet" translates to "confirm that the wallet has been saved," which is not the intended meaning of "Confirm wallet encryption."

The correct translation should be something closer to "Tabbatar da kirtse walat" or "Tabbatarda kwalkwata walat".

NO
```

```
        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Jan kunne: idan aka sakaye walet kuma aka manta laƙabin sirri, za a Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt; RASA DUKKAN BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>
    
YES. The translation includes English words within the translated text and also contains a stray "Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will". The 'ha' word for "Warning" is "Gargaɗi". The correct translation of "LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS" is "RAKA DUKKAN BITCOINS ɗinku".

Gargaɗi: idan aka sakaye walet ɗin ku kuma aka manta da kalmar sirri, za ku &lt;b&gt; RASA DUKKAN BITCOINS ƊINKU&lt;/b&gt;!
```

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?</source>
        <translation>ka tabbata kana son sakaye walet?</translation>
    
YES - The translation is problematic as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the English sentence. The word "sakaye" means "to hide" or "to conceal," whereas "encrypt" means to scramble data so it cannot be understood. The correct translation for "encrypt" in this context would be "lullata" or "rufe." The word "walet" is also not the standard Hausa word for wallet; "aljihu" is more appropriate.

Correct translation: Ka tabbata kana son lullata aljihun ka?
```

```
        <source>Wallet encrypted</source>
        <translation>an yi nasarar sakaye walet</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it uses the wrong target language. The target language is 'ha', which is Hausa. However, the translation provided is in Nigerian Pidgin English.

NO
```

```
        <source>Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet.</source>
        <translation>shigar da tsoho da sabon laƙabin sirrin walet din</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses the word "shigar da" which means "enter" but does not include the word "passphrase". The correct translation should include the word "passphrase" and also have a more accurate translation of "wallet".

Correct translation: shigar da kalmar sirrin tsoho da sabon kalmar sirrin aikin walet din
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>walet din da ake buƙatan sakayewa</translation>
    
YES - The translation is problematic because it uses the wrong word for "encrypted". The correct word for "encrypted" in this context would be "rufe" or "rufe da sirri".
Correct translation: walet din da ake buƙatan rufe
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>ana daf da sakaye walet</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The translation is not accurate and contains erroneous content. The original English text "Your wallet is about to be encrypted." means that your Bitcoin wallet will be encrypted soon. The provided Ha translation "ana daf da sakaye walet" does not convey this meaning. The word "walet" seems to be a direct transliteration of "wallet" but the rest of the sentence is nonsensical. The correct translation would be "Your wallet is about to be encrypted." in Hausa.

Here's a breakdown of why it's problematic:
*   **Accuracy:** The translation is not accurate. It does not convey the intended meaning of the source text.
*   **Erroneous Content:** The phrase "ana daf da sakaye" appears to be nonsensical in Hausa and doesn't relate to encryption or wallets.

Correct translation: **Ana fara ɓoyar walat ɗinka.**
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is now encrypted. </source>
        <translation>ka yi nasarar sakaye walet dinka</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning. The source text "Your wallet is now encrypted" means the wallet has been secured with encryption. The provided translation "ka yi nasarar sakaye walet dinka" translates to "you have successfully hidden your wallet". This is not related to encryption and misrepresents the functionality.

The correct translation should convey the meaning of encryption. A more accurate translation in Hausa for "Your wallet is now encrypted" would be:

"Walet dinka yanzu ansa masa kariya ta hanyar tattara bayanai." or a simpler and more direct "Walet dinka an kunna masa bayanan sirri."

However, since I must choose a direct translation of "encrypted" and the original provided translation has nothing to do with it, a more accurate translation would be:

"Walet dinka an tattara bayanan sirri yanzu."
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed</source>
        <translation>ba ayi nasarar sakaye walet ba</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains erroneous content. The source text "Wallet encryption failed" is translated to "ba ayi nasarar sakaye walet ba" which means "The wallet has not succeeded in protecting it." The correct translation should convey the failure of the encryption process.
"Wallet encryption failed" -> "Tsarin karin bayanai na walat ya gaza"
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation> Fitarwa</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The Hausa word for "Export" is "Fitadawa" and not "Fitarwa".

YES, The translation is inaccurate. The Hausa word for "Export" is "Fitadawa" and not "Fitarwa".
<source>Export</source>
<translation> Fitadawa</translation>
