# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

        <source>Create a new address</source>
        <translation>si adireesi tuntun</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is not accurate. "si adireesi tuntun" literally means "do new address" or "make new address", but the imperative verb "Create" in Yoruba should be "Ṣẹda" or "Ṣẹda adirẹsi tuntun".

Correct translation:
Ṣẹda adirẹsi tuntun
```

```
        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>da adiresi tuntun ti o sayan ko si eto sileti </translation>
    
ERR
The translation is understandable but contains some errors:
- "adiresi tuntun" translates to "new address", but the source says "currently selected address".
- "sileti" should be "kílípọ́ọ̀bù" (clipboard).
- There is unnecessary spacing at the end, and the wording is less natural.

Correct translation:
Da àdírẹ́sì tí o yàn sí kílípọ́ọ̀bù eto pọ́n

If you want it more literally: 
Da àdírẹ́sì tí o yàn lóri lọ sí kílípọ́ọ̀bù eto

Either are acceptable.

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>paade</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is problematic. The word "paade" is not correct in Yoruba for "Close" (as in to close a window or action). The correct term is "Pa". If meant in the UI sense for closing a window/tab, "Pa" is the accurate translation.

Correct translation:
Pa
```

```
        <source>1 year</source>
        <translation>okan ati odun</translation>
    
ERR
The translation "okan ati odun" literally means "one and year," but is not idiomatic or standard for "1 year" in Yoruba. A better translation would be "odun kan".

Correct translation:
odun kan
```
