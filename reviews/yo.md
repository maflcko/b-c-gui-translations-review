```
        <source>Create a new address</source>
        <translation>si adireesi tuntun</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is missing the verb "Create" or an equivalent action word. "si adireesi tuntun" translates roughly as "this new address" or an incomplete phrase. The correct translation should include a verb that means "Create," such as "Ṣẹda" or "Ṣẹ́dá."

Correct translation:  
Ṣẹda adirẹsi tuntun
```

```
        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>da adiresi tuntun ti o sayan ko si eto sileti </translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate and contains grammatical errors. It does not convey the meaning of "Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard." Also, it misses the concept of copying and "system clipboard" is missing or mistranslated.

Correct translation:  
"Da adirẹsi ti a ti yan lọwọlọwọ si àpótí àtẹ̀jáde eto"
```

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>paade</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "paade" is incorrect for "Close" in Yoruba. The correct translation for the command or button label "Close" (as in closing a window or dialog) is "Pa" or "Ti" depending on context, but typically "Pa" is used to mean "Close" (as in close a window or application).

Correct translation:  
Pa
```

```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>samukuro adiresi ti o sese sayan kuro ninu akojo</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains multiple errors:  
- "samukuro" should be "pa" to mean "delete" in Yoruba.  
- "ti o sese sayan" is incorrect Yoruba for "currently selected". "sese" should be "ṣeṣé" but the phrase is awkward and "ti a ti yan lọwọlọwọ" or "ti a yan lọwọlọwọ" would be better.  
- "adiresi" is correct for "address".  
- "akojo" is correct for "list".  
- The correct phrase for "Delete the currently selected address from the list" in Yoruba is:  
"Pa adirẹsi tí a ti yan lọwọlọwọ kúrò ní àkójọ"
```

```
        <source>Open a wallet</source>
        <translation>sii apamowo</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "sii apamowo" is problematic. The verb "sii" means "lift" or "raise," which is not appropriate for "open" in the context of opening a wallet. The better verb for "open" when referring to opening something like a wallet or file is "ṣii." Also, "apamowo" correctly means "wallet."

Correct translation:  
"Ṣii apamowo"
```

```
        <source>Open Wallet</source>
        <extracomment>Title of window indicating the progress of opening of a wallet.</extracomment>
        <translation>sii apamowo</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "sii apamowo" is not an accurate or natural rendering of "Open Wallet" in Yoruba ('yo'). The word "apamowo" correctly means "wallet," but "sii" generally means "open" as a verb related to opening doors or physical objects, which can be used here. However, Yoruba verbs are usually capitalized at the beginning of titles and the phrase should reflect the natural noun phrase or command form.

A more natural and correct translation would be:  
"Sii Apamowo"
```

```
        <source>1 year</source>
        <translation>okan ati odun</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "okan ati odun" means "one and year," which is incorrect for "1 year." The correct Yoruba translation for "1 year" is "ọ̀dún kan."
```
