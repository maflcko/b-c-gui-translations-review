```
        <source>Create a new address</source>
        <translation>si adireesi tuntun</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The Yoruba translation does not accurately convey the meaning of "Create a new address" in the context of Bitcoin. The word "adireesi" is not a recognized Yoruba word.

The correct translation should be:
<translation>Ṣẹ́ ìkòlù tuntun kan</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>da adiresi tuntun ti o sayan ko si eto sileti </translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The Yoruba translation is not accurate and seems to be a literal, word-for-word translation that doesn't make sense in context. The word "tuntun" means "new" which is not present in the source text.

The correct translation is:
<translation>da adiresi ti o yan ko si eto sileti </translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy</source>
        <translation>daako</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>paade</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. 'paade' does not mean 'Close' in any known language. Based on the context of Bitcoin, it's likely the word "Close" is used to dismiss a window or dialog. A more appropriate translation would be a word that signifies dismissal or closing.

Correct translation: "B'akla"

```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>samukuro adiresi ti o sese sayan kuro ninu akojo</translation>
    
YES. The translation is not a direct or accurate translation of the source text. It also contains a grammatical error. The word "samukuro" is not a recognized Yoruba word and it seems to be a misspelling of "ṣe mú kuro" which translates to "remove" or "take away". The correct translation should be:

samukuro adiresi ti o sese sayan kuro ninu akojo
YES. The translation is not a direct or accurate translation of the source text. It also contains a grammatical error. The word "samukuro" is not a recognized Yoruba word and it seems to be a misspelling of "ṣe mú kuro" which translates to "remove" or "take away". The correct translation should be:

ṣóa mu adirẹsi ti a ti yan lọwọ lọ kuro ni atokọ
```

        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Se òkèéé dátà ní tàábù lọwọlọwọ sí fáílì kán.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses an incorrect word for "export". The correct word for "export" in this context is "kọjá".

Se kọjá dátà ní tàábù lọwọlọwọ sí fáílì kán.

        <source>Open a wallet</source>
        <translation>sii apamowo</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of "Open a wallet" in the Yoruba language. The provided translation appears to be nonsensical.

```
        <source>Date</source>
        <translation>Ojo</translation>
    
YES

NO
```

```
        <source>Open Wallet</source>
        <extracomment>Title of window indicating the progress of opening of a wallet.</extracomment>
        <translation>sii apamowo</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it doesn't convey the intended meaning of "Open Wallet" in the context of Bitcoin. "sii apamowo" appears to be a literal or incorrect translation, lacking the technical meaning relevant to cryptocurrency wallets.

The correct translation should accurately reflect the action of opening a digital wallet for managing Bitcoin. A more appropriate translation in Yoruba, considering the context of a digital wallet, would be:

"Sii àpò ìnáwó" or "Ṣí àpò ìnáwó"

This translates to "Open money pouch" or "Open wallet" in a way that is more understandable in a digital or financial context.

```

        <translation>okan ati odun</translation>
