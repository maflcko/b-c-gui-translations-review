# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>afër</translation>
    
YES
The translation "afër" means "near" or "close to" in Albanian, which does not match the imperative command "Close" (as in "Close the window"). The correct translation should be in the imperative form, such as "Mbyll".

Correct translation:
Mbyll
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Enkriptimi i portofolit dështoi për shkak të një gabimi të brëndshëm. portofoli juaj nuk u enkriptua.</translation>
    
YES
There is a spelling error in the word "brëndshëm" – the correct standard Albanian is "brendshëm" (without the Ë). Also, the second sentence should start with a capital letter to match the source's structure.

Correct translation:
Enkriptimi i portofolit dështoi për shkak të një gabimi të brendshëm. Portofoli juaj nuk u enkriptua.
```

```
        <source>Tabs toolbar</source>
        <translation>Shiriti i mjeteve</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Shiriti i mjeteve" means "Toolbar" or "Tools bar" in Albanian, but it omits the "Tabs" part of the original phrase. The correct translation should explicitly mention "Tabs".

Correct translation:
Shiriti i skedave
```

```
        <source>Wallet is &lt;b&gt;encrypted&lt;/b&gt; and currently &lt;b&gt;unlocked&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>Portofoli po &lt;b&gt; enkriptohet&lt;/b&gt; dhe është &lt;b&gt; i ç'kyçur&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES
The translation states "Portofoli po enkriptohet" which means "Wallet is being encrypted," but the source says "Wallet is encrypted." Also, the translation adds an unnecessary space after "<b>" and before "enkriptohet," and before "i ç'kyçur."

Correct translation:
Portofoli është &lt;b&gt;enkriptuar&lt;/b&gt; dhe aktualisht &lt;b&gt;i ç'kyçur&lt;/b&gt;
```

```
        <source>Paste address from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Ngjit nga memorja e sistemit</translation>
    
YES
The translation omits the word "address" from the source, making it less specific and potentially confusing. The correct translation should include "adresën".

Correct translation:
Ngjit adresën nga memorja e sistemit
```

```
        <source>Paste address from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Ngjit nga memorja e sistemit</translation>
    
YES
The translation omits the word "address" from the source, making it less specific and potentially confusing. The correct translation should include "adresën".

Correct translation:
Ngjit adresën nga memorja e sistemit
```

```
        <source>Confirmed (%1 confirmations)</source>
        <translation>I/E konfirmuar(%1 konfirmime)</translation>
    
YES
There is a missing space between "konfirmuar" and the opening parenthesis. The correct translation should include a space for proper formatting.

Correct translation:
I/E konfirmuar (%1 konfirmime)
```
