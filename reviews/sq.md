# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>afër</translation>
    
YES
The translation "afër" means "near" or "close to" in Albanian, not the imperative "Close" (as in "Close the window"). The correct translation should be "Mbyll".

Correct translation:
Mbyll
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Enkriptimi i portofolit dështoi për shkak të një gabimi të brëndshëm. portofoli juaj nuk u enkriptua.</translation>
    
YES
There is a minor spelling error: "brëndshëm" should be "brendshëm". Also, the sentence capitalization should be consistent; "portofoli juaj" should start with a capital letter.

Correct translation:
Enkriptimi i portofolit dështoi për shkak të një gabimi të brendshëm. Portofoli juaj nuk u enkriptua.
```

```
        <source>Tabs toolbar</source>
        <translation>Shiriti i mjeteve</translation>
    
YES
The translation omits the word "Tabs" ("Skedat" in Albanian), so it only means "Toolbar", not "Tabs toolbar".

Correct translation:
Shiriti i skedave
```

```
        <source>Wallet is &lt;b&gt;encrypted&lt;/b&gt; and currently &lt;b&gt;unlocked&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>Portofoli po &lt;b&gt; enkriptohet&lt;/b&gt; dhe është &lt;b&gt; i ç'kyçur&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. The English "Wallet is encrypted and currently unlocked" means that the wallet, which is already encrypted, is now unlocked (open for use). The Albanian translation given conveys that "the wallet is being encrypted and is unlocked," which is incorrect.

Correct translation:
Portofoli është &lt;b&gt; i enkriptuar&lt;/b&gt; dhe aktualisht &lt;b&gt; i ç'kyçur&lt;/b&gt;
```

```
        <source>Paste address from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Ngjit nga memorja e sistemit</translation>
    
YES
The translation omits the word "address" ("adresë" in Albanian), which changes the meaning. The correct translation should specify that an address is being pasted, not just anything from the clipboard.

Correct translation:
Ngjit adresën nga memorja e sistemit
```

```
        <source>Paste address from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Ngjit nga memorja e sistemit</translation>
    
YES
The translation omits the word "address" ("adresë" in Albanian), which changes the meaning. The correct translation should specify that an address is being pasted, not just anything from the clipboard.

Correct translation:
Ngjit adresën nga memorja e sistemit
```

```
        <source>Confirmed (%1 confirmations)</source>
        <translation>I/E konfirmuar(%1 konfirmime)</translation>
    
YES
There is a formatting issue: missing space after the slash and before the parenthesis. The correct translation should also be consistent with the term "Confirmed". In Albanian, "I/E konfirmuar" is acceptable for gender neutrality, but the slash should have a space on both sides, and there should be a space before the parenthesis.

Correct translation:
I/E konfirmuar (%1 konfirmime)
```
