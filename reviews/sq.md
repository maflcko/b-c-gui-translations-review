# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>afër</translation>
    
YES. The translation is incorrect. In the context of Bitcoin, "Close" likely refers to closing a window or a menu. The Albanian word "afër" means "near" or "close to". A more appropriate translation would be "Mbyll".

NO
```

```
        <source>Enter passphrase</source>
        <translation>Futni fjalëkalimin</translation>
    
YES, The translation of "Enter passphrase" to "Futni fjalëkalimin" is incorrect. "Futni" means "enter" in the sense of kicking or inserting forcefully, which is not appropriate for a passphrase. The correct translation should convey the idea of typing or inputting the passphrase.

Correct translation: Shkruani fjalëkalimin
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Enkriptimi i portofolit dështoi për shkak të një gabimi të brëndshëm. portofoli juaj nuk u enkriptua.</translation>
    
YES: The translation contains a capitalization error. The word "portofoli" should be capitalized as it appears at the beginning of the sentence.
Enkriptimi i portofolit dështoi për shkak të një gabimi të brëndshëm. Portofoli juaj nuk u enkriptua.
```

```
        <source>Wallet unlock failed</source>
        <translation>ç'kyçja e portofolit dështoi</translation>
    
YES, the translation has a character encoding issue. The character 'ç' is not a standard Albanian character and seems to be a rendering error. The correct Albanian translation is "Dështoi zhbllokimi i kuletës".
YES,ç'kyçja e portofilit dështoi
Dështoi zhbllokimi i kuletës
```

```
        <source>Tabs toolbar</source>
        <translation>Shiriti i mjeteve</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>%1 behind</source>
        <translation>%1 Pas</translation>
    
YES
The Albanian translation of "%1 behind" is "%1 Pas". However, in the context of Bitcoin, "behind" can imply a delay or a backlog in processing. "%1 Pas" translates to "%1 behind" or "%1 after", which does not accurately convey the intended meaning of a delay or a backlog. A more appropriate translation would be "%1 mbrapa" or "%1 pas kaq kohe" to indicate a delay.
%1 mbrapa
```

```
        <source>Wallet is &lt;b&gt;encrypted&lt;/b&gt; and currently &lt;b&gt;unlocked&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>Portofoli po &lt;b&gt; enkriptohet&lt;/b&gt; dhe është &lt;b&gt; i ç'kyçur&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses the present continuous tense ("is being encrypted") while the source text uses the simple present tense ("is encrypted"). The correct translation should reflect the simple present tense.
Portofoli është &lt;b&gt; enkriptuar&lt;/b&gt; dhe është &lt;b&gt; i ç'kyçur&lt;/b&gt;
```

```
        <source>Balance:</source>
        <translation>Balanca:</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it is an incorrect translation. The correct translation for "Balance:" in Albanian is "Bilanc:".
NO
```

```
        <source>Paste address from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Ngjit nga memorja e sistemit</translation>
    
YES: The translation "Ngjit nga memorja e sistemit" means "Paste from the system memory" which is not specific to the context of Bitcoin addresses. A more appropriate translation would be "Ngjit adresën nga kujtesa" which means "Paste the address from memory".
Ngjit adresën nga kujtesa
```

```
        <source>Paste address from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Ngjit nga memorja e sistemit</translation>
    
YES: The translation "Ngjit nga memorja e sistemit" means "Paste from the system memory" which is not specific to the context of Bitcoin addresses. A more appropriate translation would be "Ngjit adresën nga kujtesa" which means "Paste the address from memory".
Ngjit adresën nga kujtesa
```

```
        <source>Confirmed (%1 confirmations)</source>
        <translation>I/E konfirmuar(%1 konfirmime)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it inaccurately translates "Confirmed" and incorrectly uses "I/E" which seems to be a typo or misinterpretation of "E" in "Confirmed". The correct translation for "Confirmed" in Albanian is "Konfirmuar".

NO, Konfirmuar (%1 konfirmime)
```
