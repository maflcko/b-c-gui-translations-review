# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Selecciona o enderezo do que recibir moedas</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is slightly off in meaning and structure. The source implies choosing the address with which to receive coins (i.e., the address used for receiving), but the Spanish translation "Selecciona o enderezo do que recibir moedas" literally reads as "Select the address of which to receive coins," which is a bit unclear and unnatural in Galician.

A better translation would be:  
"Selecciona o enderezo para recibir moedas"  
which means "Select the address to receive coins with."
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Carteira para ser encriptada</translation>
    
YES  
The term "Carteira" is Portuguese, not Galician (gl_ES). The Galician word for "wallet" is "Cartera". Also, "encriptada" is not the most appropriate Galician term; "cifrada" is commonly used for "encrypted" in Galician. The phrase should be:

"Cartera para ser cifrada"
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed</source>
        <translation>Error na Encriptación da carteira </translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes English and Galician incorrectly and contains unnecessary capitalization and spacing. "Encriptación" should be "encriptación" (lowercase) and "Error na Encriptación da carteira " has an extra trailing space. Also, "encriptación" is acceptable, but "cifrado" is more commonly used in Galician for encryption.

Correct translation:  
Error na encriptación da carteira
```

```
        <source>The old passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character.</source>
        <translation>Produciuse un erro non cambio de frase de contrasinal</translation>
    
YES  
The translation does not convey the full meaning of the source and misses critical information. It roughly translates to "An error occurred no passphrase change," which is incorrect and incomplete. Also, there is no equivalent of the technical details or instructions from the source text.

Correct translation:  
"La frase de paso antiga introducida para a descifrado da carteira é incorrecta. Contén un carácter nulo (é dicir, un byte cero). Se a frase de paso foi configurada cunha versión deste software anterior á 25.0, por favor, inténtao de novo só cos caracteres ata — pero sen incluír — o primeiro carácter nulo."
```

```
        <source>About %1</source>
        <translation>A cerca de %1</translation>
    
YES
The translation "A cerca de %1" is incorrect in Galician. The phrase "About %1" in this context means "Acerca de %1" (as in "About" a topic or item), not "a cerca de," which literally means "near" or "around" in a spatial sense.

Correct translation:
Acerca de %1
```

```
        <source>Wallet is &lt;b&gt;encrypted&lt;/b&gt; and currently &lt;b&gt;unlocked&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>A carteira está &lt;b&gt;encrypted&lt;/b&gt; e actualmente &lt;b&gt;desbloqueada&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is partly untranslated and mixes English with Galician. The word "encrypted" should be translated into Galician as "cifrada". Additionally, "actualmente" should be "actualmente" or "de momento" (both are correct, but "actualmente" is fine). The rest is correct.  

Correct translation:  
A carteira está &lt;b&gt;cifrada&lt;/b&gt; e actualmente &lt;b&gt;desbloqueada&lt;/b&gt;
```
