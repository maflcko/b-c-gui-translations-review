        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>
        <translation>Ievadiet savu paroli Jūsu maciņam, lūdzu lietojiet vismaz desmit simbolus, astoņus vai vairāk vārdus.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is missing key information from the source text. Specifically, it omits the emphasis on "random characters" and the phrase "or more". It also misses the structure of the sentence in the source.

NO. Ievadiet jaunu maciņa paroli. Lūdzu, izmantojiet vismaz desmit nejaušus rakstzīmes vai astoņus vai vairāk vārdus.

        <source>Window</source>
        <translation>Logs</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The English word "Window" is translated to "Logs" in Latvian. This is an inaccurate translation as "Window" and "Logs" have distinct meanings. In the context of Bitcoin or software in general, "Window" refers to a graphical user interface element, while "Logs" refers to a record of events.

NO
```

```
        <source>Edit Address</source>
        <translation>Mainīt adrese</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The verb "Mainīt" (to change) is not in the correct grammatical form for this context. It should be the imperative form "Mainiet" (Change, plural/formal) or the infinitive "Mainīt" used as an imperative, but "Mainīt" alone is incorrect.

NO
```

        <source>Port:</source>
        <translation>Ports:</translation>
    
YES

        <translation>Paraksti - Parakstīt / Pabaudīt Ziņojumu</translation>
