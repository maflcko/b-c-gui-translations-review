```
        <source>Copy</source>
        <translation>gayahin</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The Filipino word for "Copy" in this context should be "Kopyahin".

gayahin
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>I-exporte yung datos sa kasalukuyang tab doon sa pila</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and uses the wrong word for "file". The word "pila" in Filipino means "queue" or "pile", not "file".
The correct translation for "file" in this context would be "file" or "talaan".

Corrected translation: I-export ang datos sa kasalukuyang tab sa isang file.
```

```
        <source>Enter a Bitcoin address (e.g. %1)</source>
        <translation>I-enter ang Bitcoin address (e.g. %1)</translation>
    
YES: The translation is not in the Filipino language. The phrase "I-enter ang" appears to be Taglish, a mix of Tagalog and English.
Correct translation: Maglagay ng Bitcoin address (hal. %1)
```

```
        <source>%1 and %2</source>
        <translation>%1 at %2</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The English text "%1 and %2" translates to "%1 at %2" in Filipino. The Filipino translation should be "%1 at %2".
Correct translation: %1 at %2
```

```
        <source>default wallet</source>
        <translation>walet na default</translation>
    
YES: The translation is grammatically incorrect. In Filipino, "default wallet" should be translated to "default na wallet".
default na wallet
```

```
        <source>About %1</source>
        <translation>Mga %1</translation>
    
YES
The translation is grammatically incorrect and doesn't convey the intended meaning. The word "Mga" in Filipino is a plural marker, and it's not appropriate to use it as a translation for "About".

Correct translation: Tungkol sa %1
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Pitaka:</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Proxy is &lt;b&gt;enabled&lt;/b&gt;: %1</source>
        <translation>Ang proxy ay &lt;b&gt;in-inable&lt;/b&gt;: %1</translation>
    
YES: The word "in-inable" is not a valid Tagalog word. It seems like a misspelling or mistranslation of "enabled". The correct Tagalog word for "enabled" is "nakakabisa" or "pinagana".

Ang proxy ay &lt;b&gt;pinagana&lt;/b&gt;: %1
```

```
        <source>Settings</source>
        <translation>Setting</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses the singular form "Setting" instead of the plural form "Settings".
Correct translation: Settings
```

```
        <source>%1 client</source>
        <translation>%1 kliyente</translation>
    
YES: The translation of "client" to "kliyente" is incorrect. The correct Tagalog word for "client" is "kliyente".
%1 kliyente
```

```
        <source>Date: %1
</source>
        <translation>Datiles: %1
</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses a misspelling of "Date". The correct translation for "Date" in Filipino is "Petsa".

Petsa: %1
```

```
        <source>Wallet: %1
</source>
        <translation>Walet: %1
</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because "Walet" is a misspelling of "Wallet".
Wallet: %1
```

```
        <source>Type: %1
</source>
        <translation>Uri: %1
</translation>
    
YES. The translation of "Type" to "Uri" is incorrect in the context of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, "type" would refer to the type of address or transaction. "Uri" (Uniform Resource Identifier) is not a common term in this context.

Correct translation:
Uri: %1
Type: %1
```

```
        <source>Wallet is &lt;b&gt;encrypted&lt;/b&gt; and currently &lt;b&gt;unlocked&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>Ang pitaka ay &lt;b&gt;na-enkriptuhan&lt;/b&gt; at kasalukuyang &lt;b&gt;naka-lock&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES: The word "unlocked" was incorrectly translated as "naka-lock" (locked). The correct translation should be "hindi naka-lock" (unlocked).
Ang pitaka ay &lt;b&gt;na-enkriptuhan&lt;/b&gt; at kasalukuyang &lt;b&gt;hindi naka-lock&lt;/b&gt;
```

```
        <source>After Fee:</source>
        <translation>Bayad sa pagtapusan:</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The Tagalog word "bayad" means payment, and "pagtapusan" means end or conclusion. The phrase "Bayad sa pagtapusan" literally translates to "payment at the end". This is an inaccurate translation for "After Fee". A more accurate translation would be "Pagkatapos ng bayad" or "Matapos ang bayad", which means "After the fee/payment".

Pagkatapos ng bayad:
```

```
        <source>Date</source>
        <translation>Datiles</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "Date" in English should be translated to "Petsa" in Filipino.
Petsa
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin and address</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because "address" is a loanword and should not be translated.
Kopyahin ang address
```

```
        <source>Copy fee</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang halaga</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and doesn't convey the intended meaning of "Copy fee". The Tagalog phrase "Kopyahin ang halaga" translates to "Copy the amount" or "Copy the value", which is not the same as "Copy fee".

Correct translation:
Kopyahin ang bayarin
```

```
        <source>Copy after fee</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang after fee</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses the English word "after fee" directly, which is not a proper Tagalog translation. The correct translation should convey the meaning of "copying an amount or value that remains after the fee has been deducted."
Kopyahin pagkatapos ng bayarin
```

```
        <source>change from %1 (%2)</source>
        <translation>sukli mula sa %1 (%2)</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate. The Tagalog word for "change" in the context of transactions is "sukli" or "bayad". However, "sukli mula sa" would translate to "change from", which is grammatically correct. The English source text "change from %1 (%2)" implies a change in the transaction, and "sukli mula sa %1 (%2)" accurately conveys this meaning in Tagalog. The original assessment might have been confused by a different meaning of "sukli".

Correct translation: sukli mula sa %1 (%2)
```

```
        <source>(change)</source>
        <translation>(sukli)</translation>
    
YES - The word "sukli" means "change" in the context of giving or returning something. In the context of Bitcoin transactions, the term "change" refers to the leftover amount that is returned to the sender. A more appropriate translation would be "pera" or "kembalian".
(pera)</translation>
```

```
        <source>Disable Private Keys</source>
        <translation>Huwag paganahin ang Privbadong susi</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic because "Privbadong susi" is a misspelling of "pribadong susi" which means "private key".
Huwag paganahin ang pribadong susi
```

```
        <source>Could not unlock wallet.</source>
        <translation>Hindi magawang ma-unlock ang walet.</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses the word "Hindi" which means "not" in Tagalog. However, the correct translation should be in Filipino. The word "walet" is also a colloquial spelling of "wallet".
Hindi magawang ma-unlock ang wallet.
```

```
        <source>version</source>
        <translation>salin</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "version" to "salin" is incorrect. "Salin" in Filipino means "copy". The correct translation for "version" in the context of Bitcoin would be "bersyon" or "balangkas".

Correct translation: bersyon
```

```
        <source>IP address of the proxy (e.g. IPv4: 127.0.0.1 / IPv6: ::1)</source>
        <translation>IP address ng proxy (e.g. IPv4: 127.0.0.1 / IPv6:::1)</translation>
    
YES - The IPv6 address format in the translation has an extra colon.
Correct translation: IP address ng proxy (e.g. IPv4: 127.0.0.1 / IPv6: ::1)
```

```
        <source>Prune block storage to</source>
        <translation>I-prune and block storage sa</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical. It seems to be a literal, word-for-word translation that doesn't form a coherent phrase in Tagalog. The term "I-prune" is not a standard Tagalog verb, and "block storage sa" is also grammatically incorrect.

Correct translation: "I-prune ang imbakan ng block" or "Bawasan ang imbakan ng block"
```

```
        <source>Spendable:</source>
        <translation>Puedeng gastusin:</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Mined balance in watch-only addresses that has not yet matured</source>
        <translation>Mga naminang balanse na nasa mga watch-only address na hindi pa ligtas gastusin</translation>
    
YES - The translation is not accurate and is problematic because it implies that Bitcoin funds are unsafe to spend, which is not the intended meaning of "matured" in this context. "Matured" in Bitcoin refers to the confirmation status of a transaction, not its safety. The phrase "ligtas gastusin" (safe to spend) is an incorrect interpretation.

The correct translation should focus on the confirmation status of the funds, implying that they are not yet fully confirmed and thus might not be available for immediate use or transfer.

Correct translation: Mga na-mine na balanse sa mga watch-only address na hindi pa napoproseso.
```

```
        <source>Privacy mode activated for the Overview tab. To unmask the values, uncheck Settings-&gt;Mask values.</source>
        <translation>Na-activate ang mode ng privacy para sa tab na Pangkalahatang-ideya.  Upang ma-unkkan ang mga halaga, alisan ng check ang Mga Setting-&gt; Mga halaga ng mask.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic due to the incorrect translation of "unmask". The Filipino translation "ma-unkkan" is not a standard or understandable word. The phrase "unmask the values" implies revealing hidden information, not directly translating "unmask" as an action.

Correct translation:
Na-activate ang mode ng privacy para sa tab na Pangkalahatang-ideya. Upang ipakita ang mga halaga, alisin ang check sa Mga Setting->Itago ang mga halaga.
```

```
        <source>Transaction broadcast successfully! Transaction ID: %1</source>
        <translation>%1</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incomplete. It is missing the phrase "Transaction broadcast successfully! Transaction ID: ". The correct translation is "Matagumpay na na-broadcast ang transaksyon! Transaction ID: %1".
```

```
        <source>Type</source>
        <extracomment>Title of Peers Table column which describes the type of peer connection. The "type" describes why the connection exists.</extracomment>
        <translation>Uri</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect and misleading. "Uri" does not accurately translate "Type" in the context of Bitcoin peers. The correct translation should describe the nature of the peer connection.
Uri
```

```
        <source>QR code support not available.</source>
        <translation>Hindi magagamit ang suporta ng QR code.</translation>
    
YES, the translation is incorrect. "Hindi magagamit ang suporta ng QR code" translates to "QR code support is not available" in English, but the Filipino word for "support" is "suporta", not "suporta ng". The correct translation should be "Hindi magagamit ang suporta para sa QR code."
```

```
        <source>To specify a non-default location of the blocks directory use the '%1' option.</source>
        <translation>Upang tukuyin and non-default na lokasyon ng direktoryo ng mga block, gamitin ang '%1' na opsyon.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses the English word "non-default" instead of translating it into Filipino. The correct translation should be "hindi default".

Corrected translation: Upang tukuyin ang hindi default na lokasyon ng direktoryo ng mga block, gamitin ang '%1' na opsyon.
```

```
        <source>In:</source>
        <translation>Sa loob:</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The Filipino word for "in" in this context should be "Sa loob ng" or simply "Sa" depending on the sentence structure, but "Sa loob:" is not the appropriate translation.
The correct translation is "Sa loob ng:".
```

```
        <source>Out:</source>
        <translation>Labas:</translation>
    
YES - The Tagalog translation for "Out:" is typically "Labas:" or "Lumabas:". However, in the context of Bitcoin, "Out" likely refers to an outgoing transaction, which would be more accurately translated as "Palabas:" or "Nagbabayad:" or "Nagpadala:". "Labas" can mean "outside" or "exit," which doesn't fit the context.
Correct translation: Palabas:
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <extracomment>Context menu action to copy the address of a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Kopyahin and address</translation>
    
YES - The word "and" is not translated correctly, it should be "ang". The correct translation is "Kopyahin ang address".
```

```
        <source>Executing command without any wallet</source>
        <translation>Isinasagawa ang command nang walang anumang walet.</translation>
    
YES, The word "walet" is not a Filipino word. The correct translation for "wallet" is "wallet" or "bayong". The translation of the sentence should be: "Isinasagawa ang command nang walang anumang wallet."
```

```
        <source>Executing command using "%1" wallet</source>
        <translation>Isinasagawa ang command gamit ang "%1" walet</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains a spelling error. The word "wallet" is misspelled as "walet".
Isinasagawa ang command gamit ang "%1" wallet
```

```
        <source>No</source>
        <translation>Hindi</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "No" in Filipino is "Hindi".
Hindi is a language spoken in India.

Correct translation: Hindi
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin and address</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because "address" is a loanword and should not be translated.
Kopyahin ang address
```

```
        <source>Could not unlock wallet.</source>
        <translation>Hindi magawang ma-unlock ang walet.</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses the word "Hindi" which means "not" in Tagalog. However, the correct translation should be in Filipino. The word "walet" is also a colloquial spelling of "wallet".
Hindi magawang ma-unlock ang wallet.
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Pitaka:</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Date</source>
        <translation>Datiles</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "Date" in English should be translated to "Petsa" in Filipino.
Petsa
```

```
        <source>Insufficient funds!</source>
        <translation>Hindi sapat na pondo!</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The word "Hindi" means "no" or "not" and is not part of the Filipino language. The correct translation is "Kulang sa pondo!".
Kulang sa pondo!
```

```
        <source>After Fee:</source>
        <translation>Bayad sa pagtapusan:</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The Tagalog word "bayad" means payment, and "pagtapusan" means end or conclusion. The phrase "Bayad sa pagtapusan" literally translates to "payment at the end". This is an inaccurate translation for "After Fee". A more accurate translation would be "Pagkatapos ng bayad" or "Matapos ang bayad", which means "After the fee/payment".

Pagkatapos ng bayad:
```

```
        <source>Copy fee</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang halaga</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and doesn't convey the intended meaning of "Copy fee". The Tagalog phrase "Kopyahin ang halaga" translates to "Copy the amount" or "Copy the value", which is not the same as "Copy fee".

Correct translation:
Kopyahin ang bayarin
```

```
        <source>Copy after fee</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang after fee</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses the English word "after fee" directly, which is not a proper Tagalog translation. The correct translation should convey the meaning of "copying an amount or value that remains after the fee has been deducted."
Kopyahin pagkatapos ng bayarin
```

```
        <source>Not signalling Replace-By-Fee, BIP-125.</source>
        <translation>Hindi sumesenyas ng Replace-By-Fee, BIP-125.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect. "Hindi sumesenyas ng" translates to "Does not signal of". The correct translation should be "Hindi sumesenyas ng" which translates to "Does not signal".

Correct translation: Hindi sumesenyas ng Replace-By-Fee, BIP-125.
```

```
        <source>Confirm send coins</source>
        <translation>Kumpirmahin magpadala ng coins</translation>
    
YES. The word order is unnatural in Filipino.
Kumpirmahin ang pagpapadala ng mga coins
```

```
        <source>Warning: Unknown change address</source>
        <translation>Babala: Hindi alamang address ng sukli</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic as "Hindi alamang address ng sukli" is grammatically incorrect and awkward in Tagalog. A more natural and accurate translation would be "Babala: Hindi kilalang address ng sukli".
Babala: Hindi kilalang address ng sukli
```

```
        <source>Subtract fee from amount</source>
        <translation>Ibawas ang bayad mula sa halagaq</translation>
    
YES, there is a typo in the translation. The word "halagaq" should be "halaga".

Ibawas ang bayad mula sa halaga
```

```
        <source>Signatures - Sign / Verify a Message</source>
        <translation>Pirma - Pumirma / Patunayan ang Mensahe</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "Pirma" which means "signature" in Tagalog. However, the context of Bitcoin transactions often involves signing messages with a private key, which is usually referred to as "pagpirma" or "magpirma" for the act of signing. "Pirma" can also refer to a physical signature. While "Pirma" is not entirely wrong, "Pagpirma" would be a more accurate and contextually appropriate term for the act of signing a message in a digital/cryptocurrency context.
Pagpirma - Pirmahan / Patunayan ang Mensahe
```

```
        <source>Copy the current signature to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang kasalukuyang address sa system clipboard</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The source text refers to a "signature", but the translation uses the word "address", which is a different concept in Bitcoin. The word "signature" in the context of Bitcoin refers to the cryptographic proof of ownership of funds, while "address" refers to a destination for sending funds. The correct translation should reflect "signature".

NO, Kopyahin ang kasalukuyang signature sa system clipboard
```

```
        <source>abandoned</source>
        <extracomment>Text explaining the current status of a transaction, shown in the status field of the details window for this transaction. This status represents an abandoned transaction.</extracomment>
        <translation>inabandona</translation>
    
YES: The provided Filipino translation is incorrect and doesn't accurately convey the meaning of "abandoned" in the context of Bitcoin transactions. The correct translation for "abandoned" in this context would be "iniwan" or "tinalikuran".

Correct translation: iniwan
```

```
        <source>%1/unconfirmed</source>
        <extracomment>Text explaining the current status of a transaction, shown in the status field of the details window for this transaction. This status represents a transaction confirmed in at least one block, but less than 6 blocks.</extracomment>
        <translation>%1/hindi nakumpirma</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses the word "hindi" which means "not" in Filipino. The source text means "1/unconfirmed", so the translation should be "1/hindi pa nakukumpirma".
%1/hindi pa nakukumpirma
```

```
        <source>Date</source>
        <translation>Datiles</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "Date" in English should be translated to "Petsa" in Filipino.
Petsa
```

```
        <source>Credit</source>
        <translation>Pautang</translation>
    
YES, Pautang means loan, while Credit means something that is a blessing or a source of honor, fame, or respect. The better translation is Kredito.
        <source>Credit</source>
        <translation>Kredito</translation>
```

```
        <source>Date</source>
        <translation>Datiles</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "Date" in English should be translated to "Petsa" in Filipino.
Petsa
```

```
        <source>Immature (%1 confirmations, will be available after %2)</source>
        <translation>Hindi pa ligtas gastusin (%1 pagkumpirma, magagamit pagkatapos ng %2)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it uses a Tagalog word "Hindi pa ligtas gastusin" which means "not yet safe to spend" instead of the direct translation of "immature". Additionally, it incorrectly translates "confirmations" to "pagkumpirma" which means "confirmation" in singular form. A more accurate translation would be "Hindi pa ligtas gastusin (%1 kumpirmasyon, magagamit pagkatapos ng %2)".
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin and address</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because "address" is a loanword and should not be translated.
Kopyahin ang address
```

```
        <source>Date</source>
        <translation>Datiles</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "Date" in English should be translated to "Petsa" in Filipino.
Petsa
```

```
        <source>Could not commit transaction</source>
        <translation>Hindi makagawa ng transaksyon</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. The Filipino phrase "Hindi makagawa ng transaksyon" means "Cannot make a transaction" which is slightly different from "Could not commit transaction". A more accurate translation would be "Hindi maisagawa ang transaksyon" or "Hindi matagumpay na naisagawa ang transaksyon".

YES
Hindi maisagawa ang transaksyon
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>I-exporte yung datos sa kasalukuyang tab doon sa pila</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and uses the wrong word for "file". The word "pila" in Filipino means "queue" or "pile", not "file".
The correct translation for "file" in this context would be "file" or "talaan".

Corrected translation: I-export ang datos sa kasalukuyang tab sa isang file.
```

```
        <source>Backup Wallet</source>
        <translation>Backup na walet</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic as it uses a loanword from English ("walet") instead of the correct Filipino term for "wallet".

Correct translation: Backup ng wallet
```

```
        <source>Warning: Private keys detected in wallet {%s} with disabled private keys</source>
        <translation>Babala: Napansin ang mga private key sa walet { %s} na may mga hindi pinaganang private key</translation>
    
YES: The translation for "disabled private keys" is redundant and awkward. A more natural and accurate translation would be "may mga nakatayong private key" (with private keys that are turned off/disabled).

Babala: Napansin ang mga private key sa walet { %s} na may mga nakatayong private key
```

```
        <source>Cannot resolve -%s address: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Hindi malutas - %s address: ' %s'</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses "Hindi malutas" which is a mix of Filipino and Hindi. The correct Filipino translation for "Cannot resolve" is "Hindi malutas". Also, there is an extra space before the second '%s'.

Hindi malutas - %s address: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Insufficient funds</source>
        <translation>Hindi sapat na pondo</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of the original English text. The Tagalog phrase "Hindi sapat na pondo" translates to "Not enough funds," which is a correct translation of "Insufficient funds." However, the provided translation uses "Hindi sapat na pondo," which is not a standard Tagalog phrase. A more natural and common way to express "Insufficient funds" in Tagalog is "Walang sapat na pondo."

Correct translation: Walang sapat na pondo
```

```
        <source>Invalid -onion address or hostname: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Hindi wastong -onion address o hostname: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses the word "Hindi" which is the name of the language itself, and not a Tagalog word for "invalid". The correct translation should be "Hindi wasto".
Hindi wasto -onion address o hostname: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Invalid -proxy address or hostname: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Hindi wastong -proxy address o hostname: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation incorrectly uses "Hindi wastong" which means "Not correct" in Hindi, instead of the Filipino translation for "Invalid". The correct Filipino translation for "Invalid" is "Hindi wasto".

Hindi wasto -proxy address o hostname: '%s'

        <source>Invalid amount for -%s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Hindi wastong halaga para sa -%s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s'</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses "Hindi wastong halaga" which directly translates to "not correct amount". While understandable, the more natural and commonly used phrasing in Filipino for "Invalid amount" is "Hindi wasto ang halaga" or "Mali ang halaga". Also, the word "para sa" (for) is redundant in this context and can be omitted for a more concise translation.

Correct translation: Hindi wasto ang halaga para sa -%s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s'

        <source>Invalid netmask specified in -whitelist: '%s'</source>

        <source>Unable to create the PID file '%s': %s</source>
        <translation>Hindi makagawa ng PID file '%s': %s</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the target language is specified as 'fil' which is the ISO 639-1 code for Filipino, but the translation provided is in Hindi. The correct translation into Filipino should be: Hindi makagawa ng PID file '%s': %s.

        <source>Unknown network specified in -onlynet: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Hindi kilalang network na tinukoy sa -onlynet: '%s'</translation>
    
YES, The provided translation uses "Hindi kilalang" which is a direct translation of "Unknown" but it's not the most natural or commonly used phrasing in Tagalog for this context. A more idiomatic translation would be "Hindi kilala". Also, the word "network" is a loanword and "specified" is translated as "tinukoy". The format specifier '%s' is correctly transferred.

Correct translation: Hindi kilala ang network na tinukoy sa -onlynet: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Unsupported logging category %s=%s.</source>
        <translation>Hindi suportadong logging category %s=%s.</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses "Hindi suportadong" which means "Not supported" in Tagalog. The correct translation for "Unsupported" in Tagalog is "Hindi suportado".

NO
