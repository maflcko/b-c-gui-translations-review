        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>Phimola aterese e e tlhophilweng gompieno mo lenaaneng</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>Kopitsa</translation>
    
YES, The translation for "Copy Address" is incorrect and nonsensical. The correct translation in Setswana for "Copy Address" is "Gopisa aterese".

- **Explanation:** The provided translation "Kopitsa" does not mean "Copy Address" in Setswana. It appears to be a misinterpretation or a made-up word. "Gopisa" means "to make someone copy" or "to make someone remember", and "aterese" is the Setswana word for "address".
- **Correct Translation:** Gopisa aterese
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Kopiya le Mefuta</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "Mefuta" in Setswana means "Types" or "Kinds", which is incorrect in this context. The English word "Label" in the context of Bitcoin refers to a human-readable name associated with an address or transaction. Therefore, "Mefuta" is not an accurate translation. The correct translation for "Copy Label" would be "Kopisa Letlotlo" or "Kopisa Lebolelo".

Kopisa Letlotlo
```

```
        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>Go na le phoso fa go nepa go boloka lenane la aterese go %1. Please leka gape</translation>
    
YES - The translation has an erroneous word "go nepa" which means "to be correct". The correct translation should be "go nepa" which means "to be correct". The correct translation should be "go boammaaruri" or "go diragala".
The correct translation should be: "Go ne go na le phoso fa go nepa go boloka lenane la aterese go %1. Please leka gape".
Correct translation: "Go ne go na le phoso fa go nepego boloka lenane la aterese go %1. Please leka gape."
```

```
        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Phetolelo E Thutile</translation>
    
YES - The translation "Phetolelo E Thutile" means "Translation Failed" or "The translation failed". The source text "Exporting Failed" means that the exporting process failed. Therefore, the translation is incorrect. The correct Sesotho translation for "Exporting Failed" is "Ho romella ho hlōlehile".
Ho romella ho hlōlehile
```

```
        <source>Enter passphrase</source>
        <translation>Tsenya faele ya go tsena</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Enter passphrase" in the context of Bitcoin. The provided translation means "Enter file to enter" in Setswana.

The correct translation should be "Tsenya phasewera" or "Tsena ka phasewera".

Correct translation: Tsenya phasewera
```

```
        <source>New passphrase</source>
        <translation>Fase ya go bidiwa e ntšha</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Encrypt wallet</source>
        <translation>Tsamaisa phokotso</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The literal translation of "Encrypt wallet" is "Tsamaisa phokotso", which means "encrypt goat" in Setswana. The correct translation for "Encrypt wallet" in Setswana is "Bata phetla ya pokodoro".
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>This operation needs your wallet passphrase to unlock the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Tiro e e tlhoka polelo ya faele ya pokello ya gago go bula pokello.</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses "polelo ya faele" which translates to "file password" instead of "wallet passphrase". The correct translation for "wallet passphrase" is "phasewrase ya pokello". Additionally, "go bula pokello" translates to "to open the wallet" which is a literal translation of "unlock the wallet", however, a more natural translation would be "go notlafatsa pokello" which means "to unlock the wallet".

Correct translation: Tiro e e tlhoka phasewrase ya pokello ya gago go notlafatsa pokello.
```

```
        <source>Unlock wallet</source>
        <translation>Tshwaola pocket</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses an incorrect word for "wallet". The correct Setswana word for wallet is "thotobolo" or "mokoti".
Tshwaola thotobolo
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>
        <translation>Tsamaya ka polelo e ncha ya pasefese ya walle.&lt;br/&gt;Tlh please dirisa polelo ya go fetola ya &lt;b&gt;dintlha tse lesome kgotsa tse fetang tseo di sa ikanyegang&lt;/b&gt;, goba &lt;b&gt;Dikgang tse robong kgotsa go feta&lt;/b&gt;.</translation>
    
YES: The translation incorrectly uses "Dikgang" (meaning "news" or "stories") instead of "mafoko" or "dipolelo" for "words". It also incorrectly translates "ten or more random characters" and "eight or more words" with nonsensical phrases. The phrase "Tlh please dirisa polelo ya go fetola" is also grammatically incorrect.

Corrected translation:
Tsamaya ka polelo e ncha ya pasefese ya walle.&lt;br/&gt;Ka kopo dirisa polelo ya go fetola ya &lt;b&gt;dintshwa tse lesome kgotsa tse fetang tseo di sa ikanyegang&lt;/b&gt;, kgotsa &lt;b&gt;mafoko a a lekgolo kgotsa go feta&lt;/b&gt;.
```

```
        <source>Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Tshupisa setlhogo sa kgale le setlhogo se se ntšha sa phasphore ya wallet.</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "setlhogo" means "head" or "topic" in Setswana, which is not the correct translation for "passphrase". The correct translation for "passphrase" in this context would be "phasphose".

NO
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Puso e tla fetolelwa ka netefatso</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Puso ya gago e tla simolola go naya boloko.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is highly problematic. The word "gago" is a very offensive insult in Setswana. The phrase "go naya boloko" translates to "to give the prison" or "to be imprisoned," which is completely irrelevant to the source text about wallet encryption.

Correct translation: Puso ya gago e tla simolola go dirisiwa.
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is now encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Pasepoto ya gago jaanong e kopilwe.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is factually incorrect. The Setswana translation provided means "Your passport has now been requested." which is not related to the English source text. The correct translation for "Your wallet is now encrypted." would be "Sekatsebe sa gago se kopilwe."
```

```
        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Phetolelo E Thutile</translation>
    
YES - The translation "Phetolelo E Thutile" means "Translation Failed" or "The translation failed". The source text "Exporting Failed" means that the exporting process failed. Therefore, the translation is incorrect. The correct Sesotho translation for "Exporting Failed" is "Ho romella ho hlōlehile".
Ho romella ho hlōlehile
