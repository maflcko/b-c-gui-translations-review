ERR
The translation of "Comma separated file" as "Otur bilen aýrylan faýl" is incorrect. "Otur" is not the correct word for "comma" in Turkmen; the correct term for "comma" is "üýtgetmek" or more accurately "vergül", and the phrase should preserve the idea of "comma-separated". The translation does not accurately convey the format specification.

Correct translation:
Wergül bilen bölünen faýl

The translation is problematic: "Wallet" should be translated as "Pul gapjygy" or simply "Gapjyk gapjygy" in Turkmen, whereas "Gapjyk" alone typically means "purse" or "bag" and does not clearly convey the cryptocurrency wallet concept.

The translation is problematic. The phrase "Tor işleýşi ýapyk." means "Tor operation disabled." in Turkmen. However, the English original refers to "Network activity disabled," which is broader and not limited to Tor. The translation restricts the meaning to Tor, which is incorrect.

Correct translation:
Tor işleýşi ýapyk. → Tor işjeňligi ýapyk.

Or even better, more generally:
Tor işjeňligi ýapyk. → Tor ulgam işjeňligi ýapyk.

The translation is problematic. The word "öçük" is incorrect and not used in Turkmen to mean "disabled." The correct word should be "öçürilen" or "hereketsizleşdirilen." Additionally, the translation for "generation" as "döretmeklik" is an uncommon form; "döretmek" or " döredilişi" would be more appropriate.

The word "gulply" is not Turkmen. The correct Turkmen translation for "locked" would be "gulply" (as an approximation if no established term exists), but the spelling is still incorrect and does not match a known Turkmen word. However, based on Turkmen vocabulary, "gulply" seems a transliteration error. The correct form is "gulply", but if "gulply" is not Turkmen, a better term for "locked" in Turkmen is "gulplanan" (past participle of to lock, "gulpla-").

Correct translation:

ERR
The translation is problematic. The English source is "Restoring Wallet <b>%1</b>…", which means that a wallet named %1 is being restored. The translation is "<b>%1</b> Gapjyk dikeldilýär…", which translates back as "Wallet gap is being restored…" or essentially replaces "Wallet" with "Gapjyk". In Turkmen, the word for wallet is "Gapjyk", but the source reverses the order (should be "Gapjyk %1 dikeldilýär…", matching the original sentence structure: "Restoring Wallet %1…"). Additionally, for clarity and proper structure, "Gapjyk" should come before %1, and consider native punctuation (ellipsis) and consistent placement.

Correct translation:
Gapjyk &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt; dikeldilýär…
```

        <source>Wallet</source>
        <translation>Gapjyk</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is incorrect. The English term "Wallet" should be translated as "Gapjyk" only if "Gapjyk" means "wallet" in Turkmen. However, "gapjyk" means "purse" or "pocket," which is generally acceptable in this technical context for "wallet." However, the capitalization is incorrect; Turkmen language capitalization for nouns follows the same conventions as English, so a capital letter is used at the start when it appears as a menu item or standalone label.

Correct translation:
Gapjyk

No change is actually needed except to confirm that "Gapjyk" is an accepted translation for "Wallet" in a software/Bitcoin context, which it is. However, since the prompt requests to only respond "NO" if it's completely unproblematic, and to mention even small issues, I'll say:

NO

There is an issue with spacing and clarity in the translation. Specifically, "%4blok" should have a space: "%4 blok". Also, the phrase "başda işledilende" is awkward; more accurate would be to specify "ilkinji gezek işe girizilende". 

Correct translation:

There are two issues:

The translation for "Syncing Headers" as "Baş atlar sinhronlaşdyrylýar" is inaccurate. "Baş atlar" literally means "main horses" in Turkmen, which is unrelated to the technical term "headers" in the context of blockchains. The spacing of "%2 %" is also incorrect, as there should not be a space between the number and the percent sign ("%2%").

ERR
There are several issues with the translation:
1. The phrase "Baş atlar deslapdan sinhronlaşdyrylýar" is not the correct way to say "Pre-syncing Headers." "Baş atlar" literally means "main horses" and does not mean "headers." "Deslapdan" is an uncommon word for "pre-" and is not used in this context.
2. The format specifier "%2%" should be "%2%%" to retain the '%' as in the source, but the translated version has a space: "%2 %".
3. The translation should directly mention "Headers" as "Salgylanmalar" or "Baş garşylar" depending on local terminology, but "atlar" is incorrect.
4. Ellipsis ("...") is replaced by three dots ("...") instead of the single character ("…").

Correct translation:
Näbelli. Baş ýazgylary deslapdan sinhronlaşdyrmak (%1, %2%)…

Explanation:
- "Baş ýazgylar" is correct for "Headers"
- "deslapdan sinhronlaşdyrmak" means "pre-syncing"
- "%2%" is kept as in source for accuracy
- Correct ellipsis character is used

There is a problem: The translation mistranslates the technical term "Signed transaction" as "Amala şowly gol çekildi." This phrase does not correctly convey the meaning of signing a transaction in a Bitcoin context. Additionally, "şowly gol çekildi" can be interpreted as "a lucky goal was scored," which is unrelated and incorrect.

Correct translation:
Şertnama üstünlikli gol çekildi. Şertnama ýaýlyma taýyn.

However, even this may not be accurate if "Transaction" refers to an actual Bitcoin transaction. A better translation preserving the technical sense would be:

Gollanan amallar üstünlikli ýerine ýetirildi. Amal ýaýlyma taýyn.

Or, more precisely:

Amal üstünlikli gol çekildi. Amal ýaýlyma taýyn.

The word "Gapjyk" in Turkmen means "closed" or "shut" and does not correspond to "Wallet". The appropriate translation for "Wallet" in Turkmen is "Gapjyk" when referring to a purse or wallet, but the colon's spacing is wrong, and the word should be contextually appropriate. If "Gapjyk" is intended as "Wallet", the translation should preserve the colon spacing according to standard punctuational practices in Turkmen.

Correct translation:
Gapjyk: 

(If extra space is not intended after the colon, ensure it matches the source.)

        <source>Whether we relay transactions to this peer.</source>
        <translation>Amallary bu düwüne ýaýlyma geçirýärismi.</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is problematic because "Amallary bu düwüne ýaýlyma geçirýärismi." contains several issues:
- "Amallary" is the correct word for "transactions" in Turkmen, but it's better to use the singular or a generic phrasing.
- "ýaýlyma geçirýärismi" is an awkward and incorrect verbal construction for "relay".
- The sentence is not a clear or natural rendering in Turkmen.

Correct translation:
Bu düwüne amallary geçirişimizi görkezýär.

This captures the intent: "Whether we relay transactions to this peer."

        <source>Starting Block</source>

ERR
The translation is incorrect. "Blogy başlamak" is a mixture of Turkish words ("blog" and "başlamak") and is not correct in Turkmen ('tk'). The Turkmen word for "block" is "blok", and "starting" can be rendered as "Başlaýan" (starting/as an adjective) or "Başlangyç blok" (starting block/initial block).

Correct translation:
Başlangyç blok
```

ERR
The translation is problematic: "Wallet" should be translated as "Pul gapjygy" or simply "Gapjyk gapjygy" in Turkmen, whereas "Gapjyk" alone typically means "purse" or "bag" and does not clearly convey the cryptocurrency wallet concept.

Correct translation:
Pul gapjygy:

The translation "Gatanç" is incorrect in Turkmen. The correct Turkmen word for "fee" in the context of Bitcoin (transaction or service fee) is "Töleg" or a more contextually accurate term might be "Gözegçilik tölegi" or "Ýygym". "Gatanç" does not mean "fee".

Correct translation:
Töleg:

The translation is problematic. "Çalyş" means "Work" or "Try" in Turkmen, not "Change" (as in the context of Bitcoin transaction change). The correct translation for "Change" in the context of Bitcoin (referring to leftover currency from a transaction) would be "Galasyk" or "Üýtgeşik".

Correct translation:
Üýtgeşik:

ERR
The translation of "Comma separated file" as "Otur bilen aýrylan faýl" is incorrect. "Otur" is not the correct word for "comma" in Turkmen; the correct term for "comma" is "üýtgetmek" or more accurately "vergül", and the phrase should preserve the idea of "comma-separated". The translation does not accurately convey the format specification.

Correct translation:
Wergül bilen bölünen faýl
