        <source>Copy</source>
        <translation>Göçür</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "Göçür" means "migrate" or "resettle" in Turkish. The correct translation for "Copy" in this context (Bitcoin) should be "Kopyala".
Göçür
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>Geçir</translation>
    
YES, The 'tk' language is Turkish and the provided translation is incorrect and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The correct translation for "Export" in this context would be "Dışa Aktar".

Here's the corrected translation:

NO
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>Poz</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. 'Poz' is not a valid translation for 'Delete' in any known language.
The correct translation for 'Delete' in a context that might involve Bitcoin operations (like removing an address or transaction) would likely be a direct translation of 'Delete' into a relevant language. If the intention was a highly informal or slang term, that context is missing. Assuming a standard functional translation is desired:
Correct translation (assuming a generic functional translation is needed, as 'tk' is not a recognized language): "Delete" or "Börja" (if it's a placeholder for another language like Swedish which has this word in a different context, but not for "Delete").

Given that 'tk' is not a recognized language code, it's impossible to provide a correct translation.

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>Salgyny göçür</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. "Salgyny göçür" means "Copy the disease". The correct translation for "Copy Address" in the context of Bitcoin should be "Salgy salyp alyň".

Salgyny göçür
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Belligi göçür</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate. "Belligi göçür" translates to "Immigrate the belly," which is nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. A more appropriate translation for "Copy Label" in this context would be "Etiketi kopyala" which means "Copy the label".

Here's the corrected translation:
<translation>Etiketi kopyala</translation>
```

```
        <source>Edit</source>
        <translation>Rejele</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect and likely a misunderstanding of the source text's intent. "Rejele" in Catalan means "reject". In the context of Bitcoin editing, the likely intended word is "Edita" which means "Edit".

Edita
```

        <translation>Otur bilen aýrylan faýl</translation>
    
YES, The translation "Otur bilen aýrylan faýl" is nonsensical and does not accurately translate "Comma separated file". The correct translation in Turkmen is "Nokat bilen bölünýän faýl" or "Belgilän bilen bölünýän faýl".

NO
```

```
        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Geçirip bolmady</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic as it is not a valid translation for "Exporting Failed". The word "Geçirip bolmady" is not a recognized phrase in Turkish and does not convey the intended meaning.

The correct translation for "Exporting Failed" in Turkish is "Dışa aktarma başarısız oldu".
```

```
        <source>Change passphrase</source>
        <translation>Parol sözlemini çalyş</translation>
    
YES, the translation is erroneous. The word "sözlemini" means "agreement" or "contract", not "phrase" or "passphrase". The correct translation for "passphrase" in Turkish would be "parola" or "parola ifadesi".

Parol sözlemini çalyş
```

```
        <source>Wallet encrypted</source>
        <translation>Gapjyk şifrlenen</translation>
    
YES
The translation for "Wallet encrypted" into 'tk' is incorrect and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The provided translation "Gapjyk şifrlenen" does not convey the intended meaning of a wallet being encrypted.

Correct translation: "Gyky şifrlenen"
```

```

        <translation>Gapjygyňy şifrlemek kompýuteriňe zyýanly programma ýokuşmak arkaly bitkoinleriň ogurlanmagyndan doly gorap bilmejekdigini ýatdan çykarma.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The word "Gapjygyňy" appears to be a mistranslation of "wallet".

Correct translation: "Kompýuteriňize täsir eden mawerler arkaly bitkoýnlaryňyzyň ogurlanmagynyň gutarnykly öňüniň alynmajakdygyny ýadyňyzda saklaň."
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Şifrlenmeli gapjyk</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "gapjyk" in Turkish means "pocket" or "pouch", and it's not a suitable translation for "wallet" in the context of Bitcoin. The word "şifrlenmeli" is also a bit awkward, it should be "şifrelenmeli" (with an additional 'r').

A more accurate translation for "Wallet to be encrypted" in Turkish, considering the Bitcoin context, would be:

Şifrelenecek cüzdan
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Gapjygyň şifrlener.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic. The provided 'tk' translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the English source text in the context of Bitcoin.

The 'tk' language is likely Turkmen. The translation "Gapjygyň şifrlener." translates to "Your purse will be encrypted." While "purse" can sometimes be used colloquially for a wallet, in the context of Bitcoin, a more direct and accurate translation for "wallet" is needed. Furthermore, the grammar seems a bit off for a natural Turkmen phrase.

A more appropriate translation would be:

<source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
<translation>Siziň gapjygyňyz şifrlener. </translation>
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is now encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Gapjygyň häzir şifrlenen.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The phrase "Gapjygyň häzir şifrlenen" does not translate to "Your wallet is now encrypted" in Turkmen.

Correct translation: "Zarpyňyz häzir şifrlenen."
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Içki ýalňyşlyk sebäpli gapjygy şifrläp bolmady. Gapjygyň şifrlenmedi.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic due to the word "Içki" which means "alcoholic drink" or "internal" in Turkmen. In this context, it should be "Içerki" which means "internal". Additionally, there is a grammatical error in the second sentence. The word "şifrlenmedi" is in passive voice, and it should be in active voice to match the source text.

Corrected translation: Içerki ýalňyşlyk sebäpli gapjygy şifrläp bolmady. Gapjygyňyz şifrlenmedi.
```

```
        <source>The supplied passphrases do not match.</source>
        <translation>Üpjün edilen parol sözlemleri gabat gelenok.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and does not convey the original meaning. The word "passphrases" is translated as "parol sözlemleri" which means "password agreements" and not "passphrases". The word "supplied" is translated as "Üpjün edilen" which means "provided" or "supplied". The word "match" is translated as "gabat gelenok" which means "does not match".

Correct translation: "Tapgyrylýan şertnama sözler gabat gelmeýär."
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>Gapjygyň şifrini açmak üçin ýazylan parol sözlemi nädogry.</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses the word "Gapjygyň" which means "of the pocket" and is not related to Bitcoin wallets. The correct translation should use a word that means "wallet" in the context of Bitcoin.

NO
```

```
        <source>Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.</source>
        <translation>Gapjygyň parol sözlemi üstünlikli çalşyldy.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic because "Gapjygyň" (which means "of the gap" or "of the slot") does not accurately translate "Wallet". The correct translation for "Wallet" in this context would be "pyrimidin" or " bolso".

Correct translation: Pyrimidineň parol sözlemi üstünlikli çalşyldy.
```

```
        <source>Passphrase change failed</source>
        <translation>Parol sözlemini üýtgedip bolmady</translation>
    
YES, The translation for "Passphrase change failed" is not grammatically correct in Turkish. The correct translation should be "Parola değişikliği başarısız oldu."
Parola değişikliği başarısız oldu.

        <translation>%1 Sazlamalar faýly bozulan ýa-da ýalňyş.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it is grammatically incorrect and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. It also misinterprets the word "corrupt" in the context of a settings file.

Correct translation:
<translation>%1 sazlamalar faýly ýa-da bozuk, ýa-da nädogry bolup biler.</translation>
```

```
        <source>A fatal error occurred. %1 can no longer continue safely and will quit.</source>
        <translation>Ýowuz ýalňyşlyk ýüze çykdy. %1 indi ygtybarly dowam edip bilenok we çykar.</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses the word "ýowuz" which means "cruel" or "fierce" and is not appropriate for describing a "fatal error". A more suitable translation would be "öldüriji" or "agyr". Additionally, the word "ygtybarly" translates to "trustworthy" or "reliable" which is not the correct meaning of "safely". A better translation for "safely" would be "howpsuz" or "howpsuzly".

Correct translation: Ölümli ýalňyşlyk ýüze çykdy. %1 indi howpsuz dowam edip bilenok we çykar.
```

```
        <source>Internal error</source>
        <translation>Içki ýalňyşlyk</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic as it misinterprets "Internal error" as "Internal mistake/error" in Turkmen. The correct translation for "Internal error" in the context of Bitcoin would be a more technical term.

The accurate translation of "Internal error" in a technical context like Bitcoin would be:
Içki ýalňyşlyk
```

Sazlamalary deslapky ýagdaýyna getirmek isleýäňmi ýa-da hiçbir üýtgeşme girizmezden ýatyrmak?

        <source>%1 d</source>
        <translation>%1 g</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The 'd' in the source text is likely a unit of time (days) and translating it to 'g' (which might be interpreted as grams or something else entirely) does not make sense in the context of Bitcoin transactions.

Correct translation:
%1 d
```

```
        <source>%1 h</source>
        <translation>%1 sag</translation>
    
YES, The translation of the time unit "h" (hours) to "sag" is incorrect in Turkish. "saat" is the correct translation for hours.
%1 sag
```

```
        <source>%1 and %2</source>
        <translation>%1 we %2</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses "we" incorrectly, which does not convey the meaning of "and" in the source text. The correct translation should maintain the conjunction.
Correct translation: %1 ve %2

        <source>default wallet</source>

The translation is nonsensical and does not convey the meaning of "default wallet". The words used do not appear to be from a recognized language, or if they are, they are used in a way that is not understandable in the context of Bitcoin.

YES - The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of the original English text. The original text states that network activity is disabled, but the translation says "Tor operation is closed." Tor is a specific network, and disabling network activity is a more general statement.

YES, The word "Gapjygy" translates to "gap" or "gap". In the context of Bitcoin, "wallet" is translated to "portfel" or "gomşak" in Turkmen, not "Gapjygy". The translation should be "Portfeliňyzyň şifrlemegi üçin ulanylýan açar sözüni üýtgediň".

        <translation>Bitkoin salgylarynyň eýesidigini subut etmek üçin habarlara öz Bitkoin salgylaryň bilen gol çek</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it contains a grammatical error. In the 'tk' language, the possessive suffix should follow the noun, not precede it.

Correct translation: Bitkoýn salgylaryňyzyň eýesidigini subut etmek üçin habarlara öz Bitkoýn salgylaryňyz bilen gol çek.

        <translation>Habarlaryň görkezilen Bitkoin salgylary bilen gol çekilendigini kepillendirmek üçin habarlary tassykla</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses the word "habarlary" twice, which is redundant and makes the sentence awkward. It also translates "specified" as "görkezilen", which is not the most accurate translation in this context. A more accurate translation would be "berlen".

NO - Verify messages to ensure they were signed with specified Bitcoin addresses

YES, The translation is problematic because the phrase "Sözbaşylary sinhron ýagdaýa getirmek" does not accurately convey the meaning of "Syncing Headers" in the context of Bitcoin. The correct translation should be "Başlyklary senkronlaşdyrmak" or "Golýazmalary senkronlaşdyrmak".

NO

YES, The translation is inaccurate. The word "tor" is not related to Bitcoin. The correct translation should be "Törle ulgama baglanýarys..." which means "Connecting to the network...". Also, the provided translation uses "synhronlaşdyrmak" for synchronizing, which is incorrect. The correct word for synchronizing is "baglanmak" which means connecting.

Correct translation: Törle ulgama baglanýarys...

```
        <source>%1 behind</source>
        <translation>%1 galdy</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "galdy" is not a known word in any language. It seems like a random string of characters. The English phrase "%1 behind" usually means "%1 in the past" or "%1 ago" in a temporal context. In the context of Bitcoin, it's unclear what "%1 behind" would refer to. Assuming it refers to time, a possible translation could be "%1 geride" (meaning "%1 behind" or "%1 ago" in Turkish). However, without more context, it's difficult to provide a definitive correct translation.

        <translation>Gapjyk: %1
</translation>
    
YES, "Gapjyk" is not a recognized word or term in the context of Bitcoin or any other relevant domain. It appears to be an invented or nonsensical word, making the translation erroneous. The correct translation for "Wallet" in this context would depend on the target language, but assuming a common context or a placeholder for an unknown language, "Wallet" could be translated in various ways. However, without knowing the intended target language 'tk', a direct correction is not possible. If 'tk' is an unknown language, the correct response would be UNK_LANG. Given the lack of any recognizable translation, the best assumption is that the translation is erroneous.

Since 'tk' is not a standard language code, and without further information about what 'tk' represents, it's impossible to provide a correct translation. Thus, the response should be UNK_LANG.

The translation incorrectly translates "Label" to "Bellik". In the context of Bitcoin, "Label" typically refers to a descriptive name or tag associated with a transaction or address. "Bellik" is not a recognized term in this context.

Correct translation: Label: %1
```

```
        <source>Address: %1
</source>
        <translation>Salgy: %1

YES
The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Address". The word "Salgy" does not correspond to "Address" in any known language, and it is likely a mistranslation or nonsensical word.

Correct translation:
Address: %1

The correct translation is: Gönderilen işlem

YES: The translation provided is in Turkmen (tk). The translation for "Wallet is encrypted and currently unlocked" is "Gapjyk şifrlenen we häzirki wagtda gulpy açyk". This translation is accurate and does not contain any unwanted content, erroneous content, or spam. However, the first word "Gapjyk" is a misspelling of "Gapjyk", which is the Turkmen word for wallet. The correct translation is:

Gapjyk <b/>şifrlenen</b> we häzirki wagtda <b/>gulpy açyk</b>

YES. The translation is inaccurate and problematic. In the context of Bitcoin, "change" refers to the remaining Bitcoin after a transaction, not a literal "change" in the sense of alteration. The provided translation "Çalyş" means "change" in the sense of alteration or exchange, which is not the intended meaning.

Correct translation: Degişiklik:

        <source>Received with label</source>
        <translation>Bellik bilen kabul edildi</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses the word "Bellik" which is not a standard or recognized term in Turkish related to Bitcoin or general communication. It seems to be a made-up word. The correct translation should convey the meaning of "Received with label" in a clear and standard Turkish way.

Correct translation: Etiketle kabul edildi
```

```
        <source>Received with address</source>
        <translation>Salgy bilen kabul edildi</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "Salgy bilen kabul edildi" translates to "Received with address" in Turkmen, but the context of Bitcoin suggests a more specific meaning related to receiving funds at a particular address.

Correct translation: "Salgy salyp kabul edildi" or "Salgyňyz bilen kabul edildi" (depending on whether it's a general address or the user's address). Assuming a general sense, "Salgy salyp kabul edildi" is a better fit.

Corrected translation:

        <source>Copy label</source>
        <translation>Belligi göçür</translation>

        <source>change from %1 (%2)</source>
        <translation>%1-den gaýtargy (%2)</translation>
    
YES, the translation has an accuracy issue. The source text uses "change from" to indicate the origin of the change, likely referring to a Bitcoin transaction where change is returned from a specific address. The translation "%1-den gaýtargy (%2)" translates to "return from %1 (%2)", which is a literal translation of "return" and not the intended meaning of "change" in a financial or Bitcoin context.

A more appropriate translation would use a term that reflects the financial "change" or "remainder" from a transaction.

Correct translation: %1-den galan (%2)

YES: The translation is problematic as it uses "gapjyk" which means "bag" or "pocket" instead of "wallet". The word for wallet in this context is "hymyç". Additionally, "gapjygyň" should be "hymyçyň" to correctly indicate possession.

Correct translation: Boş hymyç emele getir. Boş hymyçlaryň başda hususy açary ýa-da skripti bolmaýar. Soňra hususy açarlar ýa-da salgylar import edilip bilner ýa-da HD esasy açar bellenip bilner.

        <source>Start %1 on system login</source>
        <translation>Ulgama hasaba girilende %1 başlat</translation>

The translation is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity. The word "başlat" is a verb, but it is used without any conjugation to agree with the subject "Ulgama hasaba girilende %1". Additionally, the phrase "Ulgama hasaba girilende" translates to "When logging into the system", but it sounds awkward and unnatural.

A more accurate and natural translation would be:

"Ulgama hasaba gireniňizde %1 işlediň."

The word "saparlaryň" or "işleriň" would be more appropriate for threads in this context.

    *   **Correct Turkish Translation:** The correct Turkish translation for "Spend unconfirmed change" in the context of Bitcoin would be "Onaylanmamış para üstünü harca" or "Onaylanmamış iadeyi kullan".

The translation uses the word "Amal" which means "deed" or "action" in Turkmen. This is not an appropriate translation for "Transaction" in the context of Bitcoin. The correct translation for "Transaction" in this context would be "Gözegçilik" or "Operasiýa".

The word "Amal" does not mean "Save" in this context, and "maglumatyny ýatda sakla" is not the correct way to say "Transaction Data".

Correct translation: Transaction data in Turkmen means "Gözegçilik maglumatlary". Therefore, "Save Transaction Data" would be "Gözegçilik maglumatlaryny ýatda sakla".

YES: The translation uses the word "Tölenmeli" which means "should be paid" or "payable" but the source text "Pays" is in present tense and indicates an action that is happening. The correct translation would be "Tölýär" or "To'leýär" to convey the present tense. Also, the word "amal" for transaction is not the most common or appropriate word to use in the context of Bitcoin. "Operasiýa" or "girew" would be better suited.

YES - The translation contains erroneous content. The word "Amalyň" means "of the operation" or "of the transaction" in Uzbek. However, the provided translation uses the Uzbek word "Amalyň" instead of the correct Turkmen word for transaction, which is "söwdanyň".

Correct translation: Söwdanyň %1 gol çekilmedik girizileni bar.

Correct translation: Magamy üçin entegem gol gerek.

YES, The translation of "URI handling" into "URI işlemeklik" is incorrect. "İşlemeklik" is not a standard or recognized Turkish word for "handling." The correct and natural way to translate "URI handling" in Turkish would be "URI işleme" or "URI yönetimi."

The word "dogry" in the translation means "correct" or "right", which is not the intended meaning of "valid" in the context of a URI. The translation should convey that the URI format is incorrect or invalid.

YES, The translation is incorrect. "Blok zynjyry" does not appear to be a valid translation for "Block chain" in any known language. It is likely a mistranslation or gibberish. A correct translation for "Block chain" in a commonly used language could be "Block chain" itself (as it's a technical term often borrowed) or a term like "Blokový řetězec" in Czech, or "Chaîne de blocs" in French. Without knowing the intended target language 'tk', it's impossible to provide a definitive correct translation. However, based on the provided source, the translation is clearly erroneous.

The phrase "akymyň çäklendirmesi" is a literal translation that might not be idiomatic. A more natural phrasing would be "oran çäklendirmesi" or "möçber çäklendirmesi".

        <source>Copy transaction ID</source>
        <translation>Geleşigiň ID-sini göçür</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and nonsensical. The word "Geleşik" in Turkmen means "arrival" or "coming", which does not relate to a transaction ID.
Geleşik iň köp ulanylýan "transaction" sözüniň dogry terjimesi däl. "Transaction" üçin dogry Türkmen sözi "yz" ýa-da "gözegçilik" bolup biler, ýöne Bitcoin konteksti üçin "yz" has amatlydyr.
"Geleşik" - meaning "arrival" is not appropriate for "transaction".
Correct translation: Yzyny kopi et

        <translation>Otur bilen aýrylan faýl</translation>

        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Geçirip bolmady</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic as it is not a valid translation for "Exporting Failed". The word "Geçirip bolmady" is not a recognized phrase in Turkish and does not convey the intended meaning.

The correct translation for "Exporting Failed" in Turkish is "Dışa aktarma başarısız oldu".
