        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>Poz</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Poz" in Turkmen does not mean "Delete." The correct Turkmen word for "Delete" is "Öçür" or "Poz." However, "Poz" can mean "Remove/delete" in some contexts, but the more commonly used and clearer term is "Öçür." If "Poz" is acceptable in context, it might be fine, but to avoid ambiguity, "Öçür" is preferred.

Correct translation:  
Öçür
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Belligi göçür</translation>
    
UNK_LANG, not familiar with the Turkmen language 'tk'.
```

```
        <source>Edit</source>
        <translation>Rejele</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Rejele" does not correspond to the English word "Edit" in the Turkmen ('tk') language. A more accurate translation for "Edit" in Turkmen is "Üýtget" or "Redaktirle".  

Correct translation:  
<translation>Üýtget</translation>
```

```
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>Otur bilen aýrylan faýl</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Otur bilen aýrylan faýl" for "Comma separated file" contains a typo. The word "Otur" should be "Otur" corrected as "Noktaly virgul bilen aýrylan faýl" or more accurately "Vergül bilen aýrylan faýl" to mean "Comma separated file" in Turkmen.

Correct translation:
Vergül bilen aýrylan faýl
```

```
        <source>Enter a Bitcoin address (e.g. %1)</source>
        <translation>(Bitkoin salgysyny giriziň (meselem, %1)</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is missing a closing parenthesis at the end of the sentence, which is present in the source. Also, the word "Bitcoin" is transliterated as "Bitkoin," which is acceptable in Turkmen, but the rest of the sentence is correct. The format specifier %1 is correctly transferred.

Correct translation:  
(Bitkoin salgysyny giriziň (meselem, %1))
```

```
        <source>%1 h</source>
        <translation>%1 sag</translation>
    
YES
The source uses "h" as an abbreviation for "hours," while the translation uses "sag," which is the full word for "hour" in Turkmen. Typically, time abbreviations remain consistent or use the standard short forms across languages, especially in technical contexts like Bitcoin. Using the full word may be less appropriate if space or format matters.

Correct translation:
%1 h
```

```
        <source>%1 and %2</source>
        <translation>%1 we %2</translation>
    
YES
The English conjunction "and" should be translated correctly in Turkmen. The provided translation uses "we," which means "and" in Turkmen, but the spacing is incorrect—there should be no extra spaces around "we" beyond a single space separating the placeholders and the conjunction. The original translation has a double space or a stray space issue.

Correct translation:
%1 we %2
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Gapjyk:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Gapjyk:" for "Wallet:" in the context of Bitcoin is incorrect. In Turkmen ('tk'), "Wallet" is commonly translated as "Jemleýji" or "Hammylaýjy" depending on context, but "Gapjyk" means "pocket," which is not the standard term used for a Bitcoin wallet.

Correct translation:
Jemleýji:
```

```
        <source>Network activity disabled.</source>
        <extracomment>A substring of the tooltip.</extracomment>
        <translation>Tor işleýşi ýapyk.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Tor işleýşi ýapyk." means "Network activity closed." The English source says "Network activity disabled." The more accurate translation for "disabled" in Turkmen would be "işjeň däl" or "işlemez" rather than "ýapyk" (which means "closed" or "shut"). Using "ýapyk" could be misleading, implying a physical closure.

Correct translation:  
Tor işleýşi işjeň däl.
```

```
        <source>Send</source>
        <translation>Iber</translation>
    
YES
The provided translation "Iber" is incorrect in Turkmen for "Send." The correct translation should be "Ugrat" or "Iber" can be acceptable but "Iber" is the transliteration and rarely used standalone in Turkmen UI context. "Ugrat" is the more appropriate and commonly used term for "Send" in Turkmen. 

Correct translation:
Ugrat
```

```
        <source>Backup Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Gapjygyň ätiýaçlyk nusgasyny sakla…</translation>
    
YES  
The translation of "Backup Wallet…" should directly convey backing up a wallet. The word "Gapjygyň" means "of the wallet," which is correct, but "ätiýaçlyk nusgasyny sakla" translates roughly to "keep a reserve copy," which is acceptable but less precise than "create a backup copy." Also, the ellipsis character (…) is used consistently.

However, a more standard and clearer translation for "Backup Wallet…" in Turkmen (tk) would be:

"Gapjygyň ätiýaçlyk nusgasyny döret…"  

("Create a backup copy of the wallet…")

So the corrected translation:

<translation>Gapjygyň ätiýaçlyk nusgasyny döret…</translation>
```

```
        <source>Sign message…</source>
        <translation>Habara gol çek…</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a spacing error: there is an extra space in "gol çek" which should be combined according to correct Turkmen usage. Also, the word "gol çek" literally means "hand draw," which is not the most accurate way to express "sign" in the context of signing a message in cryptography or Bitcoin software. A more appropriate verb is "gol çalmak" (to sign) or simply "gol goýmak." The ellipsis (…) is correctly preserved.

Correct translation:  
Habary gol goý…
```

```
        <source>Syncing Headers (%1%)…</source>
        <translation>Sözbaşylary sinhron ýagdaýa getirmek (%1%)...</translation>
    
YES  
The provided translation has a slight issue with the phrase "sinhron ýagdaýa getirmek," which is a less natural way to express "Syncing" in Turkmen. A clearer and more idiomatic phrasing would be "Sözbaşylary sinhronlaşdyrmak" or "Sözbaşylary sinhron edýär."

Also, the ellipsis in the source is a single character (…) (Unicode U+2026), but the translation uses three dots ("..."). It is preferred to use the single ellipsis character to match the source.

Correct translation:  
Sözbaşylary sinhronlaşdyrmak (%1%)…
```

```
        <source>Synchronizing with network…</source>
        <translation>Tor bilen sinhronlaşdyrmak...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Tor bilen sinhronlaşdyrmak..." translates roughly to "Synchronizing the door with..." or "Synchronizing 'Tor' with...". The original English phrase "Synchronizing with network…" means "Synchronizing with the network". The correct Turkmen word for "network" in this context should be "tor" (network), but the phrase should be in the present continuous or a form indicating ongoing synchronization. "Sinhronlaşdyrmak" is the infinitive form meaning "to synchronize," which is incorrect here. Instead, the participle or proper verbal form should be used to express "Synchronizing with network...". Also, the use of the ellipsis should be consistent with the source (… vs ...).

Correct translation:  
"Tor bilen sinhronlaşylýar…"  
(or)  
"Tor bilen sinhronlaşylýar…"  

This means "Synchronizing with the network…" in Turkmen, using the correct verb form.

Note: The original uses the ellipsis character (U+2026), so it should be preserved.

Final correct translation:  
<translation>Tor bilen sinhronlaşylýar…</translation>
```

```
        <source>%1 behind</source>
        <translation>%1 galdy</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "%1 galdy" is problematic. The English phrase "%1 behind" in the context of Bitcoin typically means that something is "%1 blocks or items behind." The word "galdy" in Turkmen means "left" or "remaining," which can convey a similar meaning but is not the best fit here, as the expression "%1 galdy" would translate more as "%1 left" rather than "%1 behind."

A more accurate Turkmen translation for "%1 behind" (indicating lagging or how far behind something is) could be:  
"%1 yza galdy"

This keeps the placeholder intact and more precisely conveys "behind" in the sense of lagging.  

Correct translation:  
%1 yza galdy
```

```
        <source>Load PSBT from clipboard…</source>
        <translation>alyş-çalyş panelinden BGÇBA ýükle…</translation>
    
YES  
The translation uses "alyş-çalyş panelinden" which literally means "exchange panel" instead of the correct term for "clipboard" in Turkmen. The accepted term for "clipboard" in Turkmen is "clipboard" or "bufer", but to keep it clear, "alyş-çalyş paneli" is incorrect here. Also, "BGÇBA" corresponds to "PSBT," so that is fine, and the ellipsis "…" is correct.

Correct translation:  
PSBT alyş-çalyş panosyndan ýükle…
```

```
        <source>Restore Wallet…</source>
        <extracomment>Name of the menu item that restores wallet from a backup file.</extracomment>
        <translation>Gapjygy dikelt…</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Gapjygy dikelt…" contains a misspelling and incorrect word forms. The correct Turkmen translation for "Restore Wallet…" (in the context of restoring from a backup) should be more like: "Gapjygy dikelt…" or "Gapjygy dikeltmek…" but the infinitive form with ellipsis is not usual as a menu item. Typically, menu items are imperative or nominal phrases. A better translation would be:  
"Gapjygy dikelt…"  
which means "Restore Wallet…" correctly.  
So the corrected translation is:  
<translation>Gapjygy dikelt…</translation>
```

```
        <source>Label: %1
</source>
        <translation>Bellik: %1
</translation>
    
YES  
The translation uses "Bellik" which is incorrect for "Label" in Turkmen. The correct Turkmen term for "Label" (as in a tag or identifier) is "Bellik". Additionally, the source text includes a newline character after %1, which should be preserved in the translation for formatting consistency.

Correct translation:  
Bellik: %1\n
```

```
        <source>Address: %1
</source>
        <translation>Salgy: %1
</translation>
    
YES  
The translation uses "Salgy" which does not correspond to "Address" in the context of Bitcoin addresses. The correct Turkmen word for "Address" (as in network or wallet address) is "Salnamasy".  

Correct translation:  
Salnamasy: %1
```

```
        <source>HD key generation is &lt;b&gt;disabled&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>HD açar döretmeklik &lt;b&gt;öçük&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a problematic word usage and form. The phrase "HD key generation is <b>disabled</b>" should reflect that the functionality is turned off or disabled in a clear, standard way. The provided translation "öçük" is uncommon or incorrect in this context. A more correct and clear translation into Turkmen for "disabled" in this technical context is "öçürilen" or "işleýär"," here "öçürilen" (turned off) fits well.

Correct translation:  
HD açar döretmeklik &lt;b&gt;öçürilen&lt;/b&gt;
```

```
        <source>Fee:</source>
        <translation>Gatanç:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Gatanç:" is incorrect for the English word "Fee:". In Turkmen, the correct translation for "Fee:" (in the context of Bitcoin transaction fee) is "Töleg:" or "Nökerlik tölegi:" depending on nuance, but commonly "Töleg:" is used for fee/payment.  
Correct translation:  
Töleg:
```

```
        <source>Change:</source>
        <translation>Çalyş:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation of "Change:" as "Çalyş:" is incorrect in the Bitcoin context. "Change" here refers to the amount of money returned in a transaction, not the verb "to change" or "effort" as the Turkmen word "Çalyş" suggests. The correct Turkmen translation should be "Galýan" or "Galnjak," which better fits the context of monetary "change."

Correct translation:  
<translation>Galýan:</translation>
```

```
        <source>Date</source>
        <translation>Sene</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Sene" is incorrect for "Date" in the context of the Turkmen language ('tk'). The correct Turkmen word for "Date" (calendar date) is "Sene" with a dotless 'e' as in "Sene", but the spelling here seems correct. However, considering common Turkmen usage, "Sene" is indeed the correct translation for "Date." There is no error in format or spacing.

Therefore, this translation is actually correct and unproblematic.

NO
```

```
        <source>Copy label</source>
        <translation>Belligi göçür</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Belligi göçür" is incorrect. "Belligi" means "its bullet" or "munition," which does not correspond to "label." The correct translation for "Copy label" in Turkmen should be "Bellik göçür" where "Bellik" means "label" or "note" and "göçür" means "copy."  

Correct translation:  
Bellik göçür
```

```
        <source>Copy after fee</source>
        <translation>Soňundan gatanjy göçür</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Soňundan gatanjy göçür" is problematic. The phrase "Copy after fee" in the Bitcoin context means copying the amount or value after deducting the transaction fee. The given translation is not accurate or idiomatic in Turkmen.  

A better translation would be:  
"Eltip bermekden soň göçür" or more naturally  
"Üstünden töleg aýrylandan soň göçür"  

However, for brevity and clarity in UI context, the recommended translation is:  
"Tölemekden soň göçür"  

If the wording needs to reflect "copy the amount after fee," then:  
"Tölek aýrylandan soň göçür"  

Hence, the correct translation:  
<TS>  
<translation>Tölek aýrylandan soň göçür</translation>  
</TS>
```

```
        <source>(%1 locked)</source>
        <translation>(%1 gulply)</translation>
    
YES  
The translation of "locked" as "gulply" appears incorrect in Turkmen. The correct translation for "(%1 locked)" in Turkmen should be "(%1 baglany)" or "(%1 gysylan)" depending on context.  
Correct translation:  
(%1 baglany)
```

```
        <source>Restoring Wallet &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt;…</source>
        <extracomment>Descriptive text of the restore wallets progress window which indicates to the user that wallets are currently being restored.</extracomment>
        <translation>&lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt; Gapjyk dikeldilýär…</translation>
    
YES
The source text indicates "Restoring Wallet <b>%1</b>…" while the translation "<b>%1</b> Gapjyk dikeldilýär…" translates roughly as "<b>%1</b> Wallet is being restored…". However, the word order in Turkmen typically places the object before the verb, so "Gapjyk" (wallet) should precede the translated phrase, and the formatting tags should include the word "Gapjyk" as in the source.

A more accurate translation preserving the original emphasis and formatting would be:

Restoring Wallet <b>%1</b>…  
→ Gapjygy <b>%1</b> dikeldilýär…

Correct translation:  
<translation>Gapjygy &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt; dikeldilýär…</translation>
```

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to close the wallet &lt;i&gt;%1&lt;/i&gt;?</source>
        <translation>&lt;i&gt;%1&lt;/i&gt; gapjygy ýapmak isleýäniňiz çynmy?</translation>
    
YES
The translation places the emphasis on "%1" at the start and omits the equivalent of "Are you sure you wish to close the wallet," resulting in less natural phrasing and missing the word for "wallet." A more accurate and natural translation in Turkmen should explicitly mention "wallet" (gapjygy) and maintain the question structure.

Correct translation:
Gapjygy &lt;i&gt;%1&lt;/i&gt; ýapmak isleýäniňize çynmy?
```

```
        <source>Wallet</source>
        <translation>Gapjyk</translation>
    
YES  
The provided translation "Gapjyk" is incorrect for the English word "Wallet" in the Turkmen language ('tk'). The correct Turkmen word for "Wallet" (as used in the context of Bitcoin or general wallet) is "Jübüt" or "Gapjygy" (meaning small pocket or wallet).  

Correct translation:  
<translation>Gapjygy</translation>
```

```
        <source>Encrypt Wallet</source>
        <translation>Gapjygy şifrle</translation>
    
YES  
The word "Gapjygy" in Turkmen means "wallet," but it is misspelled here. The correct spelling is "Gapyjy." Also, depending on context, "şifrle" (encrypt) is correct. The correct translation should be:

Gapyjy şifrle
```

```
        <source>Edit sending address</source>
        <translation>Iberýän salgyny rejele</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Iberýän salgyny rejele" is incorrect. The correct translation for "Edit sending address" in Turkmen should be:  
"Ugratmak salgysyny üýtget"
```

```
        <source>name</source>
        <translation>at</translation>
    
YES
The English word "name" is translated as "at" in Turkmen, which is accurate. There are no format specifiers or spacing issues. However, depending on the context, "at" is the correct Turkmen word for "name." If the context requires a different nuance, it may vary, but generally, "at" is correct here.

Correct translation:
at
```

```
        <source>When you click OK, %1 will begin to download and process the full %4 block chain (%2 GB) starting with the earliest transactions in %3 when %4 initially launched.</source>
        <translation>OK basanyňyzda, %1%4 başda işledilende %3-däki iň irki amallardan başlap doly %4blok zynjyryny (%2 GB) ýükläp we işläp başlar.</translation>
    
YES
The translation has spacing issues and a missing space between "%1" and "%4", as well as between "%4" and "blok". The phrase "%4 blok zynjyryny" should have a space to separate the number placeholder and the word "blok". Also, the original sentence is clearer if the placeholders remain distinct.

Correct translation:
OK basanyňyzda, %1 %4 başda işledilende %3-däki iň irki amallardan başlap doly %4 blok zynjyryny (%2 GB) ýükläp we işläp başlar.
```

```
        <source>%1 is currently syncing.  It will download headers and blocks from peers and validate them until reaching the tip of the block chain.</source>
        <translation>%1häzir sinhronlaşdyrylýar. Ol düwünlerden baş atlary we bloklary ýükläp alar we blok zynjyrynyň ujuna ýetýänçä olary  barlar.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has formatting issues with spacing after "%1" and before "häzir". Also, "baş atlary" should be corrected to "başlyklary" to accurately mean "headers". A clearer and properly spaced translation would be:

%1 häzir sinhronlaşdyrylýar. Ol düwünlerden başlyklary we bloklary ýükläp alar we blok zynjyrynyň ujuna ýetýänçä olary barlar.
```

```
        <source>Unknown. Syncing Headers (%1, %2%)…</source>
        <translation>Näbelli. (%1, %2 %) Baş atlar sinhronlaşdyrylýar...</translation>
    
YES  
There is an unnecessary space between the %2 and the % sign in the translation. Additionally, the word order places the parameters before the descriptive text differently than in the source. A more accurate and correctly formatted translation would be:

Näbelli. Baş atlar sinhronlaşdyrylýar (%1, %2%)…
```

```
        <source>Unknown. Pre-syncing Headers (%1, %2%)…</source>
        <translation>Näbelli. (%1, %2 %) Baş atlar deslapdan sinhronlaşdyrylýar...</translation>
    
YES  
There is a whitespace issue in the format specifier "%2 %". In the source, "%2%" has no space between the number and the percentage sign, but in the translation there is a space: "%2 %". This could cause formatting problems.

Correct translation:  
Näbelli. (%1, %2%) Baş atlar deslapdan sinhronlaşdyrylýar...
```

```
        <source>Paste address from clipboard</source>
        <extracomment>Tooltip text for button that allows you to paste an address that is in your clipboard.</extracomment>
        <translation>Salgyny alyş-çalyş tagtasyna giriz</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Salgyny alyş-çalyş tagtasyna giriz" is problematic because it does not accurately convey "Paste address from clipboard." The phrase "alyş-çalyş" means "exchange" or "swap," which is not correct in the context of "clipboard." Also, "Salgyny" (address) is in the accusative case, which is appropriate, but "tagtasyna" means "to the board" and is a direct translation of "to the board," not necessarily "clipboard."

A better translation would be:

"Salgyny alyş-çalyş tagtasyndan göçür"  

or more precisely for "Paste address from clipboard":

"Salgyny meýdany alyjyndan goý" 

However, the common term for "clipboard" in Turkmen is "alyş-çalyş tagtasy" or simply "alyş-çalyş tagtasy," but the best phrase for "Paste" is "goý" (put).

Therefore, the corrected version is:

"Salgyny alyş-çalyş tagtasyndan goý"  
which means "Paste the address from the clipboard."
```

```
        <source>Automatically start %1 after logging in to the system.</source>
        <translation>Ulgama hasaba girilenden soň %1awtomatiki usulda başlat.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has a missing space between "%1" and "awtomatiki". Also, "Ulgama hasaba girilenden soň" is a literal but somewhat awkward translation of "after logging in to the system." A clearer, more natural Turkmen phrasing would separate the words properly and consider a better phrasing for "after logging in to the system."

Correct translation:  
Ulgama hasaba girilenden soň %1 awtomatiki usulda başlat.
```

```
        <source>Prune block storage to</source>
        <translation>Blok goruny çäklendir</translation>
    
YES  
The English phrase "Prune block storage to" is incomplete on its own, typically followed by a size or amount (e.g., "Prune block storage to %d MB"). The translation "Blok goruny çäklendir" means "Limit block storage," which conveys a similar idea, but it omits the needed trailing preposition "to" which indicates the quantity to prune to.

A better translation would keep the structure implying the "to" is followed by a size:

Correct translation:  
"Blok gorunyny şu mukdara çenli çäklendir"  
(which means "Limit block storage up to [amount]").  

If format specifiers like %d follow in the UI, this translation would fit correctly.
```

```
        <source>GB</source>
        <translation>GB çenli</translation>
    
YES
The translation "GB çenli" means "up to GB," which adds extra meaning not present in the source. The source simply states "GB" (likely referring to gigabytes or the country code), so the translation should be exactly "GB" without any additions.

Correct translation:
GB
```

```
        <source>Enable RPC server</source>
        <extracomment>An Options window setting to enable the RPC server.</extracomment>
        <translation>RPC serwerini işlet</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "RPC serwerini işlet" appears to use "işlet," which means "to operate" or "run," but a more appropriate and natural translation for "Enable RPC server" in Turkmen would be "RPC serverini ýola goý" or "RPC serverini ýandır," depending on the common Turkmen usage for "enable." Additionally, "serwer" should be spelled as "server" or the Turkmen equivalent if applicable. The use of "-ini" is correct as an accusative suffix indicating the object.

Correct translation:  
RPC serverini ýola goý
```

```
        <source>Wallet</source>
        <translation>Gapjyk</translation>
    
YES  
The provided translation "Gapjyk" is incorrect for the English word "Wallet" in the Turkmen language ('tk'). The correct Turkmen word for "Wallet" (as used in the context of Bitcoin or general wallet) is "Jübüt" or "Gapjygy" (meaning small pocket or wallet).  

Correct translation:  
<translation>Gapjygy</translation>
```

```
        <source>Whether to set subtract fee from amount as default or not.</source>
        <extracomment>Tooltip text for Options window setting that sets subtracting the fee from a sending amount as default.</extracomment>
        <translation>Komissiýanyň möçberden aýtdyrman kesilmegini bellemelimi ýa-da ýok.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains errors and does not correctly convey the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "set subtract fee from amount as default or not" relates to configuring a setting to subtract the fee from the total amount by default. The translated sentence incorrectly uses "Komissiýanyň möçberden aýtdyrman kesilmegini" which is unclear and awkward in Turkmen, and "bellemelimi ýa-da ýok" is an unnatural phrasing for "whether to set ... or not".

Correct translation:  
"Komissiýanyň möçberden aýylmagyny standart edip goýmakmy, ýokmy."
```

```
        <source>Subtract fee from amount by default</source>
        <extracomment>An Options window setting to set subtracting the fee from a sending amount as default.</extracomment>
        <translation>Komissiýany möçberden aýtdyrman kes</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has a spacing issue: "möçberden" should be "möçberden" without any extra spacing, which is OK here, but the phrase "aýtdyrman kes" is incorrect. The verb "aýtdyrman" means "without telling" or "without saying," which does not fit here. The correct translation should mean "Subtract the commission from the amount by default," so it should use a phrase like "öňürti boýunça" (by default) and a correct verb form for "subtract."

Correct translation:  
"Ýerine ýetirilende möçberden tölegi aýyrmak"  
Or, more literally:  
"Komissiýany möçberden öňüni alyş görnüşde aýyr"  
A simpler and clearer version:  
"Komissiýany möçberden önde aýyrmak"  

Given the context, a recommended corrected translation is:  
"Komissiýany möçberden öňüni alyşlykda aýyrmak"  

Alternatively, a fluent translation:  
"Komissiýany möçberden önde aýyrmak"
```

        <translation>bellenen</translation>
    
YES  
The 'tk' translation "bellenen" is incorrect for the English word "default." In Turkmen, the correct translation for "default" (in the context of a preset or standard option) is "saýlanan" or "üniýet". "Bellenen" means "designated" or "appointed," which is close but not the commonly accepted term for "default." 

Correct translation:  
saýlanan
```

```
        <source>Could not read setting "%1", %2.</source>
        <translation>%1, %2 sazlamasyny okap bolmady.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation misses the phrase "Could not read setting" and only includes "%1, %2 sazlamasyny okap bolmady." which translates roughly as "%1, %2 setting could not be read." The order of parameters is changed compared to the source, which can affect meaning and clarity. The correct translation should clearly mention the phrase "Could not read setting" and include the placeholders in the correct order.

Correct translation:  
%1 sazlamasyny okap bolmady, %2.
```

        <source>Total of transactions that have yet to be confirmed, and do not yet count toward the spendable balance</source>
        <translation>Indi tassyklanmaly we entek sowup boljak balansa geçirilmedik amallaryň hemmesi</translation>
    
YES
The translation is somewhat unclear and can be misleading. The English source states: "Total of transactions that have yet to be confirmed, and do not yet count toward the spendable balance," implying a summary/count of unconfirmed transactions not yet reflected in the spendable balance.

The provided Turkmen translation: "Indi tassyklanmaly we entek sowup boljak balansa geçirilmedik amallaryň hemmesi" roughly translates to "All the transactions that need to be confirmed now and have not yet been transferred to the spendable balance." The phrase "Indi tassyklanmaly" ("need to be confirmed now") slightly changes the immediacy, and "hemmesi" ("all") suggests listing all such transactions rather than the total amount, which might confuse the meaning.

A clearer translation preserving the numerical/total meaning would be:

"Entäk tassyklanmandyr we entäk ulanylmaly balansa goşmaýan amallaryň jemi" 

which means:

"Total of transactions not yet confirmed and not yet added to the spendable balance."

This preserves the focus on the total sum rather than the transaction list.

Correct translation:
Entäk tassyklanmandyr we entäk ulanylmaly balansa goşmaýan amallaryň jemi
```

```
        <source>PSBT Operations</source>
        <translation>PSBT amallary</translation>
    
YES  
The word "amallary" is incorrect or not meaningful in Turkmen for "Operations." The correct translation for "PSBT Operations" in Turkmen would be:  
PSBT amallary
```

```
        <source>Copy to Clipboard</source>
        <translation>Alyş-çalyş buferine göçür</translation>
    
YES  
The provided translation contains an erroneous word "Alyş-çalyş" which means "exchange" or "trade," not "copy." The correct Turkmen translation for "Copy to Clipboard" is:  
"Bufer ýerine göçür"
```

```
        <source>Signed transaction successfully. Transaction is ready to broadcast.</source>
        <translation>Amala şowly gol çekildi. Amal ýaýlyma taýyn.</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses non-standard or incorrect vocabulary and phrasing for the context. "Amala şowly gol çekildi." is unclear and does not convey "Signed transaction successfully." properly. Similarly, "Amal ýaýlyma taýyn." could be better phrased.

A more accurate Turkmen translation would be:
"Amal üstünlikli gol çekildi. Amal ýaýradylmaga taýýar."

This means:
"Transaction was signed successfully. Transaction is ready to broadcast."

        <translation>Möhlet</translation>
    
YES  
The 'tk' translation "Möhlet" is incorrect for the English word "Age" in this context. The correct translation of "Age" (meaning duration or length of time) in Turkmen is "Ýaş".  

Correct translation:  
Ýaş
```

```
        <source>Blocksdir</source>
        <translation>Blok binýadynyň deslapdan bellenmedik ýerini görkezmek üçin  opsiýasyny ulanyň.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. The source text "Blocksdir" is a single word, most likely referring to "blocks directory" or a directory name, but the translation is a full sentence meaning "Use the option to specify the default unspecified location of the block base." This is an incorrect and overly elaborate translation that does not correspond to the source. The translation should be a similarly short term or a direct transliteration appropriate to context.

Correct translation:  
Blocksdir

        <source>Wallet: </source>
        <translation>Gapjyk:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Gapjyk:" does not accurately represent the English word "Wallet:" in the context of Bitcoin. The word "Wallet" usually refers to a Bitcoin wallet address or a software managing Bitcoin funds.  
Correct translation: "Jelek:"

        <source>Whether we relay transactions to this peer.</source>
        <translation>Amallary bu düwüne ýaýlyma geçirýärismi.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic: the phrase "Amallary bu düwüne ýaýlyma geçirýärismi." contains errors in spelling, spacing, and grammar. The word "Amallary" should be correct, but "düwüne" appears to be a misspelling of "düwünä" (meaning "node" or "peer" in Turkmen). Also, "ýaýlyma" appears to be a misspelling; the correct word is "ýaýlyma" but more appropriate in context would be "ýaýratmak" for "relay." The question particle "geçirýärismi" should be separated into "geçirýärmi" + "?" or "geçirýärmi." 

A better translation would be:  
"Amallary bu düwünä ýaýratýarysmy?"

Or, more formally:  
"Amallary bu düwünä ýaýratýarysmy?"

This translates back as: "Do we relay transactions to this peer?"

Corrected translation:  
Amallary bu düwünä ýaýratýarysmy?
```

```
        <source>Starting Block</source>
        <translation>Blogy başlamak</translation>
    
YES  
The translated word "Blogy" appears to be a transliteration or incorrect form of "Block". The correct Turkmen word for "Block" in the Bitcoin context should be "Blok" without the extra 'y'. Also, there is no extraneous spacing issue.

Correct translation:  
Blok başlamak
```

        <translation>Salgylary bu düwüne ýaýlyma geçirýärismi.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Salgylary bu düwüne ýaýlyma geçirýärismi." contains a spacing error and unclear structure: "düwüne" should be "düwüne" (button) but it is misspelled as "düwüne" (which is correct), however "ýaýlyma" is likely a typo of "ýaýlyma" (relay). Also, there is a missing space before "ismi" and the sentence should end with a question mark to match the English meaning "Whether we relay addresses to this peer."

Correct translation:  
"Salgylary bu düwüne ýaýlyma geçirýärmi?"
```

        <translation>Salgyny göçür</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Salgyny göçür" translates as "Copy the salam" or "Copy the greeting" in Turkmen, which is incorrect in this context. The correct translation for "Copy address" (copy the address) should use the word for "address" rather than "salam" or similar.

Correct translation:  
"Salgy göçür"
```

```
        <source>Copy label</source>
        <translation>Belligi göçür</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Belligi göçür" is incorrect. "Belligi" means "its bullet" or "munition," which does not correspond to "label." The correct translation for "Copy label" in Turkmen should be "Bellik göçür" where "Bellik" means "label" or "note" and "göçür" means "copy."  

Correct translation:  
Bellik göçür
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Gapjyk:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Gapjyk:" for "Wallet:" in the context of Bitcoin is incorrect. In Turkmen ('tk'), "Wallet" is commonly translated as "Jemleýji" or "Hammylaýjy" depending on context, but "Gapjyk" means "pocket," which is not the standard term used for a Bitcoin wallet.

Correct translation:
Jemleýji:
```

```
        <source>Date</source>
        <translation>Sene</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Sene" is incorrect for "Date" in the context of the Turkmen language ('tk'). The correct Turkmen word for "Date" (calendar date) is "Sene" with a dotless 'e' as in "Sene", but the spelling here seems correct. However, considering common Turkmen usage, "Sene" is indeed the correct translation for "Date." There is no error in format or spacing.

Therefore, this translation is actually correct and unproblematic.

NO
```

```
        <source>Fee:</source>
        <translation>Gatanç:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Gatanç:" is incorrect for the English word "Fee:". In Turkmen, the correct translation for "Fee:" (in the context of Bitcoin transaction fee) is "Töleg:" or "Nökerlik tölegi:" depending on nuance, but commonly "Töleg:" is used for fee/payment.  
Correct translation:  
Töleg:
```

```
        <source>Change:</source>
        <translation>Çalyş:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation of "Change:" as "Çalyş:" is incorrect in the Bitcoin context. "Change" here refers to the amount of money returned in a transaction, not the verb "to change" or "effort" as the Turkmen word "Çalyş" suggests. The correct Turkmen translation should be "Galýan" or "Galnjak," which better fits the context of monetary "change."

Correct translation:  
<translation>Galýan:</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy after fee</source>
        <translation>Soňundan gatanjy göçür</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Soňundan gatanjy göçür" is problematic. The phrase "Copy after fee" in the Bitcoin context means copying the amount or value after deducting the transaction fee. The given translation is not accurate or idiomatic in Turkmen.  

A better translation would be:  
"Eltip bermekden soň göçür" or more naturally  
"Üstünden töleg aýrylandan soň göçür"  

However, for brevity and clarity in UI context, the recommended translation is:  
"Tölemekden soň göçür"  

If the wording needs to reflect "copy the amount after fee," then:  
"Tölek aýrylandan soň göçür"  

Hence, the correct translation:  
<TS>  
<translation>Tölek aýrylandan soň göçür</translation>  
</TS>

        <source>Paste address from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Salgyny alyş-çalyş tagtasyna giriz</translation>
    
YES
The English phrase "Paste address from clipboard" refers to pasting an address (likely a Bitcoin address) from the clipboard. The translation "Salgyny alyş-çalyş tagtasyna giriz" roughly means "Enter the address into the clipboard," which reverses the direction of the action and is incorrect.

Correct translation:
"Salgyny alyş-çalyş tagtasyndan goş"
```

```
        <source>Paste address from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Salgyny alyş-çalyş tagtasyna giriz</translation>

YES  
The translation "Sene" is incorrect for "Date" in the context of the Turkmen language ('tk'). The correct Turkmen word for "Date" (calendar date) is "Sene" with a dotless 'e' as in "Sene", but the spelling here seems correct. However, considering common Turkmen usage, "Sene" is indeed the correct translation for "Date." There is no error in format or spacing.

Therefore, this translation is actually correct and unproblematic.

The translation "Belligi göçür" is incorrect. "Belligi" means "its bullet" or "munition," which does not correspond to "label." The correct translation for "Copy label" in Turkmen should be "Bellik göçür" where "Bellik" means "label" or "note" and "göçür" means "copy."  

Correct translation:

The translation "Otur bilen aýrylan faýl" for "Comma separated file" contains a typo. The word "Otur" should be "Otur" corrected as "Noktaly virgul bilen aýrylan faýl" or more accurately "Vergül bilen aýrylan faýl" to mean "Comma separated file" in Turkmen.
