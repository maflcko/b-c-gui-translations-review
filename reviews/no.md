# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Advarsel: Hvis du krypterer lommeboken din og mister passordet, vil du 1 MISTE ALLE BITCOINENE DINE 1 !</translation>
    
YES: The translation incorrectly includes "1" before and after "LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS". This is likely a misinterpretation of the bold tags. The bold tags should be translated, not replaced with numbers.

Correct translation: Advarsel: Hvis du krypterer lommeboken din og mister passordet, vil du <b>MISTE ALLE BITCOINENE DINE</b>!
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>
        <translation>Skriv inn det nye passordet for lommeboken. 1 Vennligst bruk et passord med 2 ti eller flere tilfeldige tegn 2, eller 3 åtte eller flere ord 3.</translation>
    
YES: The translation includes extraneous numbers (1, 2, 3) that do not appear in the source text.
Correct translation: Skriv inn det nye passordet for lommeboken.<br/>Please use a passphrase of <b>ten or more random characters</b>, or <b>eight or more words</b>.
```

```
        <source>Wallet unlock failed</source>
        <translation>Låsing av lommebok mislyktes</translation>
    
YES
The translation provided is in Swedish, not 'no'.
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>%1 didn't yet exit safely…</source>
        <translation>%1 avsluttet ennå ikke trygt…</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses the Norwegian word "avsluttet" which translates to "ended" or "concluded". In the context of Bitcoin and software, the intended meaning of "exit safely" is to shut down properly. The correct Norwegian translation for "exit safely" would be "avsluttet trygt" or "lukket trygt".

YES. %1 avsluttet ennå ikke trygt…
```

```
        <source>Modify configuration options for %1</source>
        <translation>Endre konfigurasjonsalternativer for %1</translation>
    
YES: The language specified by 'no' is Norwegian, not 'no' (which is an English word). The translation is otherwise accurate.
Correct translation: NO
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses</source>
        <translation>Åpne node-feilsøkings- og diagnostikkonsoll</translation>
    
YES - The translation is completely unrelated to the source text. The source text "Sending addresses" likely refers to Bitcoin addresses from which funds are being sent. The translation "Åpne node-feilsøkings- og diagnostikkonsoll" translates to "Open node debugging and diagnostics console".
Correct translation: Sende adresser
```

```
        <source>Window</source>
        <translation>Vindu 
</translation>
    
YES, the translation has trailing whitespace. The correct translation is "Vindu".
```

```
        <source>Bytes:</source>
        <translation>Byte:</translation>
    
YES: The translation incorrectly changes the plural "Bytes" to the singular "Byte".
Correct translation: Byte:
```

```
        <source>Change:</source>
        <translation>Veksel</translation>
    
YES. The translation is incorrect and doesn't fit the context of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, "change" refers to the remaining amount of Bitcoin after a transaction. "Veksel" in Danish means "bill of exchange" or "exchange note", which is not related to the concept of transaction change.

The correct translation for "Change" in the context of Bitcoin is:

<translation>Vekselpenge</translation>
```

```
        <source>Tree mode</source>
        <translation>Trevisning</translation>
    
YES: The translation "Trevisning" does not accurately convey the meaning of "Tree mode" in the context of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, "tree mode" likely refers to a way of visualizing or organizing data in a hierarchical structure, such as a Merkle tree. "Trevisning" is not a recognized term in this context and appears to be an invented word.

Correct translation: Träd-läge
```

```
        <source>Lock unspent</source>
        <translation>Lås ubrukte</translation>
    
YES: The translation is for Norwegian, not the specified language 'no'. The correct translation in Norwegian is "Lås ubrukte". The correct translation for the specified language 'no' is UNK_LANG.
```

```
        <source>Copy fee</source>
        <translation>Kopier gebyr</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. "Kopier gebyr" translates to "Copy fee" in Danish, not Norwegian. The correct Norwegian translation is "Kopier avgift".
Kopier avgift
```

```
        <source>Window</source>
        <translation>Vindu
