        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>Tikiake matau ki te whakamāori i te kupu whakamāoritanga:
Right-click to edit address or label</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. The provided 'mi' translation is not actually a translation of the English text but includes unrelated words about translation ("whakamāori" means "to translate" in Māori), and the English text is simply repeated.

Correct translation:
Pāwhiri-matau ki te whakatika i te wāhitau, i te tapanga rānei
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Whakapau kaha te raraunga i te whārangi o nāianei ki tētahi kōnae</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. "Whakapau kaha" generally means "to make a great effort" or "expend energy," which does not fit "Export." A more accurate translation for "Export the data in the current tab to a file" would be:

"Tukua atu ngā raraunga kei te ripa o nāianei ki tētahi kōnae"

Correct translation:  
Tukua atu ngā raraunga kei te ripa o nāianei ki tētahi kōnae
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Ko ēnei ngā whakamāoritanga mō ō whakamahi Bitcoin hei tuku moni. Tirohia i te moni me te wāhi whiwhi i mua i te tuku i ngā moni.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. "Whakamāoritanga" means "translations" or "interpretations", which is incorrect here. The source refers to "addresses". Additionally, "ō whakamahi Bitcoin" translates as "your use of Bitcoin", which is not accurate. The instructions about checking amount and receiving address could be clearer and more literal.

Correct translation:
Ko ēnei ō wāhitau Bitcoin hei tuku utu. Me āta tirotiro i te rahinga me te wāhitau whiwhi i mua i te tuku moni.
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</source>
        <translation>Ko ēnei ngā whakamāoritanga mō ō whakaaetanga Bitcoin hei whiwhi utu. Whakamahi i te pātene 'Waihanga whakaaronga hōu' i te pae whiwhi ki te whakapūmau i ngā whakaaronga hōu.
Ko te whakakī i ēnei whakaaronga e taea ana anake ki ngā whakararuraru o te momo 'tawhito'.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has several issues:

1. The word "whakamāoritanga" means "translations", which is not suitable for "addresses".
2. The English "receiving address" is not correctly translated; "whakaaronga" is more like "directions" or "orientations", not "addresses".
3. The translation for "Signing" is not accurate, and "whakararuraru" translates to "troubles" or "disturbances" rather than referring to "addresses of the type 'legacy'".
4. There is confusion throughout with word and intent choices.

Correct translation:
Ko ēnei ō wāhitau Bitcoin hei whiwhi utu. Whakamahia te pātene 'Hanga wāhitau whiwhi hōu' i te ripa whiwhi kia waihanga wāhitau hōu.
Ka taea anake te haina ki ngā wāhitau momo 'tuku iho'.

Explanation:
- "wāhitau" = address, fits the Bitcoin context.
- "hanga" or "waihanga" = create.
- "whiwhi" = receive.
- "ripa" = tab (for computing/UI).
- "haina" = sign (as with cryptographic keys).
- "tuku iho" = legacy, can be used in digital contexts.
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Tātari  Tapanga </translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Tātari Tapanga" is problematic. "Tātari" means "filter" or "wait", not "copy". The correct translation for "Copy Label" should use the word for "copy", which in Māori is "Tārua". Also, there is an unnecessary space before and after the word "Tapanga".

Correct translation:  
Tārua Tapanga
```

```
        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Kore te whakapau kore</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Kore te whakapau kore" is incorrect and nonsensical. "Whakapau" can mean "to spend" or "to exhaust", not "export". The word "export" in Māori is usually "kaweake". A suitable translation would be:

Correct translation:
Kāore i angitū te kaweake
```

```
        <source>New passphrase</source>
        <translation>Tūtohi hōu</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Tūtohi hōu" translates more closely to "new document" or "new chart", not "New passphrase". The correct translation for "New passphrase" in Māori ('mi') would be:

Correct translation:
Kupuhipa hōu
```

```
        <source>This operation needs your wallet passphrase to unlock the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Kia whakapiri tēnei mahi ki tō whakapuaki moni hei whakawhiti i te whare moni.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. The English text says, "This operation needs your wallet passphrase to unlock the wallet." The translation given means something more like "Please attach this action to your wallet statement to transfer the money house," which is inaccurate and awkward.

Correct translation:  
Me whakauru koe i tō kupuhipa pūkete hei iriti i te pūkete mō tēnei mahi.
```

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?</source>
        <translation>Kei te whakapau kaha koe ki te whakakino i to whare moni?</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. "whakakino" means "to spoil" or "to damage," which isn't appropriate here. "Encrypt" should be translated as "whakamuna" or similar in Māori. Also, "whare moni" is literally "money house," but "tautohu pūkete" or "pūkete" is a better fit for "wallet" in the Bitcoin context.

Correct translation:
Kei te tino hiahia koe ki te whakamuna i tō pūkete?
```

```
        <source>Wallet encrypted</source>
        <translation>Whakakorengia te wharetaonga</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Whakakorengia te wharetaonga" means "Delete/remove the wallet/treasure" rather than "Wallet encrypted." The correct translation for "Wallet encrypted" in Māori should be closer to "Kua whakamunakihia te pēke" ("The wallet has been encrypted").

Correct translation:
Kua whakamunakihia te wharetaonga

(Note: "wharetaonga" is okay for "wallet", or "pēke" can be used as "bank/wallet".)
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>
        <translation>Whakauruhia te kīangahipa hou mo te putea. Whakamahia he kupu huna kia tekau, neke atu ranei nga tohu matapōkere 2, 3 waru neke atu ranei nga kupu 3</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic for several reasons:
- The translation omits the HTML formatting (&lt;br/&gt; and &lt;b&gt; ... &lt;/b&gt;) present in the source. These are important for conveying the correct display.
- It does not accurately capture "Please use a passphrase of ten or more random characters, or eight or more words."
- The translation includes numbers "2, 3 waru" (2, 3, eight) which is nonsensical and confusing.
- "kīangahipa" is a constructed word that may not be idiomatic/recognizable for 'passphrase' in Māori; usually "kupu huna" or similar is used.
- There are missing format instructions (like no &lt;br/&gt; in the translation) and the guidance about passphrase length is muddled.

Correct translation (with formatting and improved clarity):

Whakauruhia te kupu huna hou mō te putea.&lt;br/&gt;Tēnā whakaputahia he kupu huna kia &lt;b&gt;tekau, neke atu rānei ngā tohu matapōkere&lt;/b&gt;, rānei &lt;b&gt;waru, neke atu rānei ngā kupu&lt;/b&gt;.

Explanation:
- "kupu huna" is more idiomatic for 'passphrase'.
- Length instructions are consistent with the source.
- HTML formatting is preserved.
```

```
        <source>Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Whakauru te kupu whakapākehā me te kupu hōu mō te pēke moni.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The word "whakawhakamāori" or "kupuhipa" is commonly used for "passphrase" or "password" in Māori, not "kupu whakapākehā", which actually means "English phrase" or "to translate into English". Additionally, "pēke moni" is a literal translation of "money bag" or "bank" rather than "wallet". "Pūkete" is a more appropriate term for "wallet" in this context.

Correct translation:
Whakauruhia te kupuhuna tawhito me te kupuhuna hōu mō te pūkete.
```

```
        <source>Remember that encrypting your wallet cannot fully protect your bitcoins from being stolen by malware infecting your computer.</source>
        <translation>Mahara kia whakakorehia te whakakino i ō wharepukapuka kia whakararuraru i ō wharepūkoro.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. The 'mi' (te reo Māori) translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the English source text, and instead appears to be nonsensical or a mistranslation. The terms used do not correctly reflect "encrypting your wallet", "cannot fully protect your bitcoins", "being stolen", or "malware infecting your computer".

A better translation would be:

Mahara ahakoa ka whakamunatia tō pūkete, kāore e taea te tiaki katoatia i ō bitcoin kia kore e tāwhaihia e tētahi pūmanawa kino ka pangia tō rorohiko.

This more accurately communicates the original message in appropriate Māori for the context.
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Whakakī i te pēke</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Whakakī i te pēke" means "Fill the bag" or "Fill the wallet", which is incorrect in this context. The English phrase denotes that the wallet will be encrypted, not filled.

Correct translation:  
"Kia whakamuna te pūkete" (where "pūkete" means wallet and "whakamuna" means to encrypt).

So the correct translation is:  
<translation>Kia whakamuna te pūkete</translation>
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Kei te whakakorehia tō pēke moni.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incorrect. "Kei te whakakorehia tō pēke moni." means "Your wallet is being deleted" or "Your wallet is being removed," which does not accurately convey "Your wallet is about to be encrypted." "Whakakorehia" means "to be cancelled/removed," whereas "whakaākaratia" or "whakamuna" means "to be encrypted."

Correct translation:  
Kei te tata whakamunatia tō pēke moni.
```

```
        <source>IMPORTANT: Any previous backups you have made of your wallet file should be replaced with the newly generated, encrypted wallet file. For security reasons, previous backups of the unencrypted wallet file will become useless as soon as you start using the new, encrypted wallet.</source>
        <translation>HEMENGĀ: Me whakakapi ngā tāruarau i mua i te whakaputa i te kōnae pēke whakamahi kē o tō wharemoni ki te kōnae pēke hōu, whakakapi. Hei ētahi take whakamarumaru, ka whakakore ngā tāruarau i mua i te kōnae pēke kore whakakapi, ka whiwhi whakamahi i te kōnae pēke hōu, whakakapi.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has multiple issues:
- "HEMENGĀ" is not the standard way to say "IMPORTANT" in Māori ("He mea nui:" or "Aroha mai:" are more appropriate).
- The sentence structure is confusing and does not communicate the advice accurately.
- The meaning is significantly altered with awkward phrasing ("whakakapi" is repeated and misplaced, "kōnae pēke whakamahi kē" does not properly translate "wallet file", and "whiwhi whakamahi" is not idiomatic).
- There are stray commas and double-use of "whakakapi".
- Some terms like "wharemoni" are not standard for "wallet" in cryptocurrency context.

Correct translation:
HE MEA NUI: Me whakakapi ō tārua kōnae pūkete kua tāruatia ki te kōnae hou kua whakarākeitia/kua whakamunatia. Hei whakamarumaru, ka koretake ngā tārua kōnae pūkete kāore i whakamunatia ina tīmata koe ki te whakamahi i te kōnae hou kua whakamunatia.
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed</source>
        <translation>Kati te whakamātau i te whakakorenga wharetaonga</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incorrect and does not reflect the meaning of "Wallet encryption failed". The provided translation seems to mention "testing the cancellation of the warehouse/treasury", which is not accurate for "Wallet encryption failed".

Correct translation:  
I rahua te whakamunatanga o te pūkete  
OR  
I rahua te whakamunatanga o te wharetaonga

(Note: "pūkete" is often used for "wallet", and "whakamunatanga" for "encryption".)
```

```
        <source>Wallet unlock failed</source>
        <translation>Kati te whakakore i te whakatuwhera o te whareparakau</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Kati te whakakore i te whakatuwhera o te whareparakau" is problematic in multiple ways:
- "Kati te whakakore" suggests "stop the canceling," which does not correspond to "unlock failed."
- "Whakatuwhera" means "open," which is not the same as "unlock" in this context.
- "Whareparakau" is a transliteration for "wallet," but may not be the best cultural or standard term.

A more accurate translation would be:
"I rahua te whakawetui i te pūkete moni"
or
"Kāore i angitu te iriti i te putea"

Therefore, the correct translation should be:
<translation>Kāore i angitu te iriti i te putea</translation>
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>Ko te kupuhipa i whakauruhia mō te whakapau kōnae whakamāhukihuki, he hē.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is erroneous. "whakapau kōnae whakamāhukihuki" does not correctly convey "wallet decryption", and the whole phrase is unnecessarily complex and inaccurate. "Kupuhipa" is correctly used for "passphrase", but "wallet" should be "pūkete" and "decryption" can be "whakamāori" or "wetemuna".

Correct translation:
Ko te kupuhipa i whakauruhia mō te wetemuna i te pūkete, he hē.
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character. If this is successful, please set a new passphrase to avoid this issue in the future.</source>
        <translation>Ko te kupu whakapā atu i whakauruhia mō te whakapau kōnae kore tika. Kei roto i te kupu whakapā he pūāhua kore (hei tauira - he tūmomo kore). Ki te whakapau kōnae te kupu whakapā i te wā i whakatūria ai tēnei whakamahi i mua i te 25.0, whakamātau anō ki te whakapau kōnae ki te whakakore i tēnei raruraru i te wā e whai ake nei.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic for several reasons:  
1. The original message refers to the "passphrase entered for the wallet decryption," but the translation uses terms like "whakapau kōnae," which means something like "consuming a file," which is not correct for "decryption."  
2. Important details are omitted, such as the description of a "null character (ie - a zero byte)" and the instructions to try up to the first null character.  
3. The overall meaning is significantly changed and confusing.  

Correct translation (closer to intent, but note that 'mi' for technical terms can vary):  
Ko te kupuhipa i whakauruhia mō te whakatuwhera i te pūkete moni he hē. Kei roto i te kupuhipa tētahi pūāhua kore (arā, he byte kore/zero byte). Mēnā i tautuhia te kupuhipa ki tētahi putanga o tēnei pūmanawa i mua i te 25.0, whakamātau anō mā te whakamahi i ngā pūāhua tae noa ki te pūāhua kore tuatahi anake. Mēnā ka angitū koe, tautuhia koa tētahi kupuhipa hōu kia karo i tēnei raruraru ā muri ake nei.
```

```
        <source>Passphrase change failed</source>
        <translation>Kua whakapau kē te whakarerekē i te kupu whakapākehā.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The phrase "kua whakapau kē te whakarerekē i te kupu whakapākehā" is incorrect for multiple reasons:

1. "Kupu whakapākehā" means "translation/English word", not "passphrase."
2. The structure "kua whakapau kē te whakarerekē" is unnatural and doesn't correspond to "change failed." 
3. The translation should convey "failed to change the passphrase" or "change of passphrase failed".

Correct translation:
I rahua te whakarerekē i te kupuhipa

Explanation:
- "Kupuhipa" is the commonly used term for "passphrase" or "password" in Māori.
- "I rahua te whakarerekē" means "the change failed" or "failed to change."

Final correct translation:
<translation>I rahua te whakarerekē i te kupuhipa</translation>
```

```
        <source>IP/Netmask</source>
        <translation>IP/NetmaskIP/Netmask</translation>
    
YES
The translation simply repeats the English "IP/Netmask" and duplicates it, which is erroneous. For Māori ('mi'), the English technical term may often be retained due to lack of a common Māori equivalent, but duplication is a clear mistake.

Correct translation:
IP/Netmask

Or, if a Māori adaptation is desired (though uncommon):
IP/ĀraiWhatunga

But retaining "IP/Netmask" (without duplication) is most accurate in this technical context.
```

```
        <source>Settings file %1 might be corrupt or invalid.</source>
        <translation>Settings file %1 me whakapōrearea, me whakararuraru rānei.</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses the English "Settings file" rather than translating it into Māori. Moreover, "me whakapōrearea, me whakararuraru rānei" translates more like "caused trouble, or caused disturbance," which does not accurately convey "might be corrupt or invalid." There is also an extra comma, resulting in awkward phrasing.

A better translation would be:
"Ākene kua kino, kāore rānei e tika ana te konae tautuhinga %1."

Correct translation:
<translation>Ākene kua kino, kāore rānei e tika ana te kōnae tautuhinga %1.</translation>
```

```
        <source>A fatal error occurred. %1 can no longer continue safely and will quit.</source>
        <translation>I whakararuraru mate. Ka whakakore %1 i te whakararuraru haumaru, ka whakakore hoki.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The original source says "A fatal error occurred. %1 can no longer continue safely and will quit." The translation given is: "I whakararuraru mate. Ka whakakore %1 i te whakararuraru haumaru, ka whakakore hoki." This translation is awkward and not accurate. "I whakararuraru mate" means "a fatal problem/disruption," but the rest of the structure is misleading, particularly "Ka whakakore %1 i te whakararuraru haumaru, ka whakakore hoki" which means "%1 will cancel (something) in the security disturbance, will also cancel" — this does not clearly state that the program cannot continue safely and will quit.

A more accurate translation would be:
I puta he hapa nui. Kāore e taea e %1 te haere tonu ā-haumaru, ā, ka puta atu.

This translation more accurately reflects the original meaning:
A fatal error occurred. %1 can no longer continue safely and will quit. → I puta he hapa nui. Kāore e taea e %1 te haere tonu ā-haumaru, ā, ka puta atu.
```

```
        <source>An internal error occurred. %1 will attempt to continue safely. This is an unexpected bug which can be reported as described below.</source>
        <translation>Kua puta he hapa ā-roto. Ka whakamātau a %1 ki te whakarite i te whakararuraru i te āhua haere tonu. He hē whakararuraru tēnei e whakapātaitia ana i raro i te whakamārama i raro nei.</translation>
    
YES
There are issues with clarity and unnatural phrasing in the translation. The phrase "ka whakamātau a %1 ki te whakarite i te whakararuraru i te āhua haere tonu" is awkward and does not clearly correspond to "will attempt to continue safely". Also, "he hē whakararuraru tēnei e whakapātaitia ana i raro i te whakamārama i raro nei" is a confusing construction for the guideline about reporting bugs.

Correct translation (more natural and accurate Māori):

Kua puta tētahi hapa ā-roto. Ka ngana a %1 ki te haere tonu i runga i te haumaru. He raru tēnei kāore i tūmanakotia, ka taea te pūrongo i raro nei kia rite ki ngā tohutohu.

This version more directly and naturally conveys the meaning of the original English source.

        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Kore te whakapau kore</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Kore te whakapau kore" is incorrect and nonsensical. "Whakapau" can mean "to spend" or "to exhaust", not "export". The word "export" in Māori is usually "kaweake". A suitable translation would be:

Correct translation:
Kāore i angitū te kaweake
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Whakapau kaha te raraunga i te whārangi o nāianei ki tētahi kōnae</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. "Whakapau kaha" generally means "to make a great effort" or "expend energy," which does not fit "Export." A more accurate translation for "Export the data in the current tab to a file" would be:

"Tukua atu ngā raraunga kei te ripa o nāianei ki tētahi kōnae"

Correct translation:  
Tukua atu ngā raraunga kei te ripa o nāianei ki tētahi kōnae
```

```
        <source>Input not found or already spent</source>
        <translation>Kāore i kitea te urupare, kua whiwhi i mua, kua whiwhi rānei.</translation>
    
YES
The translation has some issues:
- "urupare" usually means "response" or "reply", not "input" in the context of Bitcoin transactions.
- "kua whiwhi" means "have received" which doesn't match "already spent". 
- The correct translation should accurately reflect the technical meaning.

Correct translation:
Kāore i kitea te urunga, kua noho rānei. 

("urunga" is closer to "input"; "kua noho" can mean "already used" or "spent")
```

```
        <source>Invalid -i2psam address or hostname: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Kore whakaaetanga -i2psam wāhitau rite, ingoa wāhi: '%s'</translation>
    
YES
The translation is not fully accurate. "Kore whakaaetanga" means "not permitted" or "not accepted," but the intended meaning is "invalid." A more precise translation for "Invalid" would be "Hē" or "Hē te." Also, "address or hostname" should be "wāhitau, ingoa pūtirotiro ipurangi" or "wāhitau, ingoa tūmau" depending on nuanced usages, but at least "hostname" should be "ingoa tūmau" not "ingoa wāhi," which is just "place name."

Correct translation:
Hē te wāhitau -i2psam, ingoa tūmau rānei: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Invalid P2P permission: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Invalid P2P whakaaetanga: '%s'</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses "Invalid" directly from English instead of translating it into 'mi' (Māori). This is not an accurate translation.

Correct translation:
He whakaaetanga P2P muhu: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Invalid netmask specified in -whitelist: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Kua whakapau kaha te netmask kore whaimana i whakarārangi i roto i te -whitelist: '%s'</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. The phrase "Kua whakapau kaha te netmask kore whaimana i whakarārangi i roto i te -whitelist" is awkward and does not convey the meaning of "Invalid netmask specified in -whitelist." "Kua whakapau kaha" means "has tried hard" or "has put in a lot of effort," which is not relevant here. Also, the structure of the sentence does not match the original intent.

A more accurate translation in Māori would be:
"I tohua he netmask muhu ki te -whitelist: '%s'" 

This translates more directly to "An invalid netmask was specified in -whitelist: '%s'".
```

```
        <source>Invalid port specified in %s: '%s'</source>

        <source>Loading P2P addresses…</source>
        <translation>Whakararuraru P2P addresses ...</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic for several reasons:
- "Whakararuraru" commonly means "trouble" or "problem", not "loading".
- "addresses" is untranslated and should be in Māori.
- The ellipsis (…) in the source is replaced by three dots "...", which should ideally match the source formatting.

A better translation would be:
"Kei te uta i ngā wāhitau P2P…"

Corrected translation:
<translation>Kei te uta i ngā wāhitau P2P…</translation>
```

```
        <source>Loading banlist…</source>
        <translation>Whakararuraru ana, ka whakapau kaha ki te whakamāori i te kupu whakamāoritanga.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incorrect and unrelated to the source text. The source "Loading banlist…" refers to the process of loading a list of banned items/users. The given Maori translation reads as "Having trouble, will strive to translate the translation," which is not equivalent in meaning.

Correct translation:
"Kei te uta rārangi aukati…"
```

```
        <source>Loading block index…</source>
        <translation>Whakaritea te rārangi whakaputa...</translation>

The translation is problematic because "Whakaritea te rārangi whakaputa" means "Prepare the output list", which does not accurately convey "Loading block index". The core idea is about loading the index of blocks, not output or preparing a list.

Correct translation:
"Kei te uta i te rārangi paraka…" or "Kei te uta i te īkoi paraka…"

A suitable version could be:
<translation>Kei te uta i te rārangi paraka…</translation>
```

```
        <source>Loading wallet…</source>
        <translation>Whakararuraru pūtea...</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Whakararuraru pūtea..." is incorrect. "Whakararuraru" means "trouble" or "disrupt," not "loading." The correct translation for "Loading wallet..." should use a term like "Utaina" or "Kei te uta pūtea..." or "Kei te utaina te pūtea..."

Correct translation:
Kei te uta pūtea...
```

```
        <source>Rescanning…</source>
        <translation>Whakarerekētia...</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. "Whakarerekētia" means "to modify" or "has been modified," which does not correctly capture the meaning of "Rescanning…" in the Bitcoin context (i.e., scanning again, usually for transactions). The correct Maori translation should reflect the act of scanning again, e.g., "Kei te tātaritanga anō…" or "Kei te āta rapu anō…"

Correct translation:
Kei te tātaritanga anō...
or
Kei te āta rapu anō...
```

```
        <source>SQLiteDatabase: Failed to prepare statement to verify database: %s</source>
        <translation>SQLiteDatabase: Kua whakakorehia te whakarite i te kupu hei whakamāmā i te papakupu: %s</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The term "kumamā" is used for "verify", which more commonly means "to make easier" or "to relieve", and "papakupu" means "dictionary", not "database". The translation gives the wrong meaning. Also "kua whakakorehia te whakarite" is "preparation was canceled", not "failed to prepare". The format specifier %s is correctly preserved.

Correct translation:
SQLiteDatabase: I rahua te whakarite i te tauākī hei manatoko i te pātengi raraunga: %s
```

```
        <source>SQLiteDatabase: Failed to read database verification error: %s</source>
        <translation>SQLiteDatabase: Kua whakapau kaha te pānui i te hapa whakamātau o te papamahi: %s</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The term "kua whakapau kaha te pānui" literally means "has tried hard to read" or "has spent much effort reading", which does not accurately convey "failed to read". Also, "pāpamahi" refers to "desktop", not "database". The correct word for "database" in Māori would be "pātengi raraunga". Thus, the translation incorrectly refers to a desktop rather than a database.

Correct translation:
SQLiteDatabase: I rahua te pānui i te hapa manatoko pātengi raraunga: %s
```

```
        <source>SQLiteDatabase: Unexpected application id. Expected %u, got %u</source>
        <translation>SQLiteDatabase: Tino whakararuraru te tuhinga whakamahi. Tūpono %u, ka whiwhi %u</translation>
    
YES
The translation is not accurate. "Tino whakararuraru te tuhinga whakamahi" does not accurately convey "Unexpected application id". Also, "Tūpono" does not mean "Expected".

Correct translation:
SQLiteDatabase: Kīhanga taupānga ohorere. I whakaarohia %u, i whiwhi %u
```

```
        <source>Signing transaction failed</source>
        <translation>Ko te whakakore i te whakauru i te whakaritenga</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incorrect. The source text "Signing transaction failed" refers to an error in the digital signing process for a transaction. The current translation "Ko te whakakore i te whakauru i te whakaritenga" more closely means "Cancelling the inclusion in the arrangement," which is not accurate and introduces erroneous content.

Correct translation:
I rahua te haina i te whakawhitinga

Explanation:  
"I rahua" = (has failed)  
"te haina" = (the signing)  
"i te whakawhitinga" = (of the transaction)
```

```
        <source>Specified -walletdir "%s" does not exist</source>
        <translation>Kāore i te whiwhi i te -walletdir i whakaritea "%s"</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate. The original means "Specified -walletdir '%s' does not exist", i.e., the directory specified by -walletdir does not exist. The translation given ("Kāore i te whiwhi i te -walletdir i whakaritea") reads more like "Did not receive the specified -walletdir", which is incorrect.

Correct translation:
Kāore te -walletdir i tohua "%s" i te noho (i reira)  
or  
Kāore e kitea te -walletdir i tohua "%s"

Either suggests that the directory cannot be found or does not exist.
```

```
        <source>Specified -walletdir "%s" is not a directory</source>
        <translation>Kāore i te whare tūmatanui te -walletdir i whakaritea "%s"</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "Kāore i te whare tūmatanui" translates more like "is not a public building," which does not carry the meaning of "is not a directory" in the computing/Bitcoin context. The word "whare tūmatanui" is not appropriate for "directory" as a folder in a filesystem. Also, the format specifier %s has been placed correctly.

Correct translation:
Kāore te -walletdir i whakaritea "%s" he kōpaki.

Explanation:
- "kōpaki" is the correct Māori term for "directory" or "folder" in computer context.
```

```
        <source>Starting network threads…</source>
        <translation>Whakamāori i te tekau whakahaere whatunga...</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The original English means "Starting network threads…" (referring to starting background processes or threads related to networking). The provided 'mi' translation, "Whakamāori i te tekau whakahaere whatunga...", appears to translate to "Translating ten network administrators..." or similar, which is incorrect. 

The correct translation should convey the idea of starting (initiating) network threads or processes. A more accurate translation might be:
"Kei te tīmata ngā whenu whatunga..." 

So, the response should be:

YES
The translation does not correctly convey "Starting network threads…". A better translation would be:
Kei te tīmata ngā whenu whatunga...
```

```
        <source>The specified config file %s does not exist</source>
        <translation>Kāore te kōnae whirihoranga i whiwhi i te %s i te wā e whakapau kore ana</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. The original English sentence "The specified config file %s does not exist" should simply state that the config file does not exist. The provided translation introduces unrelated phrases: "i whiwhi" (to receive/get) and "i te wā e whakapau kore ana" (while expending nothing/doing nothing), which is incorrect and confusing.

Correct translation:
Kāore te kōnae whirihoranga kua tohua, arā %s, e noho ana.

Or, more simply:
Kāore te kōnae whirihoranga %s i te wātea.
```

```
        <source>The wallet will avoid paying less than the minimum relay fee.</source>
        <translation>Ka whakakore te pōkeka i te utu iti ake i te utu tawhiti i te iti rawa.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The word "pōkeka" is not a well-established translation for "wallet" in Māori, and the entire phrasing is unnatural and misleading. Also, "utu tawhiti" does not convey "relay fee" (which is a technical Bitcoin term). The translation is unclear and could confuse users.

Correct translation:
Ka karo te pūkete i te utu i raro iho i te utu tuku pāpāho iti rawa.
```

```
        <source>This is the minimum transaction fee you pay on every transaction.</source>
        <translation>Ko tēnei te utu whakaritenga iti rawa ka whiwhi koe i ia whakaritenga.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. The original sentence says it is the minimum transaction fee "you pay," but the translation means "the minimum fee you receive" (ka whiwhi koe = you receive). The verb should indicate 'pay', which in Māori is commonly "utu" or "whakarato", not "whiwhi".

Correct translation:
Ko tēnei te utu whakawhitinga iti rawa ka utua e koe mō ia whakawhitinga.
```

```
        <source>This is the transaction fee you will pay if you send a transaction.</source>
        <translation>Ko te utu whakawhiti tāuta tēnei ka utu e whiwhi ana koe ki te tuku i tētahi tāuta.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. It is not accurate and contains awkward phrasing. The words "whakawhiti tāuta" and "tāuta" are not appropriate here (they seem to mean "installation" not "transaction"). In Māori, "transaction" is usually rendered as "hokohoko" or "whakawhiti moni". Also, the structure is confusing.

A more accurate translation would be:
Ko te utu whakawhiti moni tēnei ka utu koe mēnā ka tuku koe i tētahi whakawhiti moni.

Explanation:
- "whakawhiti moni" better captures "transaction".
- Sentence structure is improved for clarity in Māori.
```

```
        <source>Transaction amounts must not be negative</source>
        <translation>Kāore e whakaaetia ngā moni whakaritenga kia whakararuraru.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. The Māori translation "Kāore e whakaaetia ngā moni whakaritenga kia whakararuraru" does not accurately represent "Transaction amounts must not be negative". It seems to imply that transaction amounts should not cause trouble/disturbance, which is not the intended meaning.

Correct translation:  
Kāore e taea te waiho hei tau whakataurangi ngā moni whakawhitinga.  
—or—
Me kaua ngā nui whakawhitinga e noho hei tau tōraro (negative).
```

```
        <source>Transaction change output index out of range</source>
        <translation>He whakawhitiwhitinga whakaputanga hōputu whakararuraru te tūnga</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The phrase "Transaction change output index out of range" refers to the index (position) of the "change output" in a Bitcoin transaction being out of the allowable range. The provided Māori ('mi') translation does not accurately convey this meaning and appears confusing—using terms like "whakawhitiwhitinga whakaputanga hōputu whakararuraru te tūnga" which seems to mix unrelated words.

A correct translation should closely reflect the technical nature:

Correct translation (suggestion):
Kua puta te rārangi o te tūtohi putanga huringa o te whakawhitinga ki waho i te rohe

Explanation:
- "whakawhitinga" = transaction
- "putanga huringa" = change output
- "tūtohi" or "kaitohu" (index)
- "ki waho i te rohe" = out of range
```

```
        <source>Transaction must have at least one recipient</source>
        <translation>Me whiwhi whakaritenga tātari tētahi whiwhi whakaritenga ki te kaiwhiwhi kotahi i te minimuma</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. The provided 'mi' (Māori) translation does not accurately convey the source meaning and includes several awkward or incorrect constructions. It appears to be partly machine-generated and does not clearly state the requirement: "Transaction must have at least one recipient."

A more appropriate translation would be:
Me kākā te whakawhitinga ki te kotahi kaiwhiwhi i te iti rawa.

Explanation:  
- "Me kākā" = must have  
- "te whakawhitinga" = the transaction  
- "ki te kotahi kaiwhiwhi" = to at least one recipient  
- "i te iti rawa" = at least

Correct translation:
Me kākā te whakawhitinga ki te kotahi kaiwhiwhi i te iti rawa.
```

```
        <source>Transaction needs a change address, but we can't generate it.</source>
        <translation>He hiahia te whakarerekē i te whakaritenga whakaritenga, engari kāore e taea e mātou te whakaputa.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. The phrase "Transaction needs a change address" specifically refers to Bitcoin's "change address," not to a generic alteration or modification. The translation uses "whakarerekē," which means "change" in the sense of alteration, not as used in Bitcoin jargon. Also, "whakaritenga whakaritenga" is a repetition and seems erroneous.

Correct translation might be:
E hiahia ana te whakawhitinga ki tētahi wāhitau huringa, engari kāore e taea e mātou te whakaputa.

("wāhitau huringa" = change address in this context)
```

```
        <source>Transaction too large</source>
        <translation>He whakawhitiwhitinga nui rawa te whakapau kaha</translation>
    
YES
The translation "He whakawhitiwhitinga nui rawa te whakapau kaha" is problematic.

Explanation:
- "whakawhitiwhitinga" means "discussion" or "exchange" in the sense of dialogue/conversation, not "transaction" in a financial or technical sense.
- "nui rawa te whakapau kaha" translates as "too much effort/exertion", which is unrelated to the original meaning of "Transaction too large" (which refers to the size of a Bitcoin transaction).

Correct translation:
"He nui rawa te whakawhitinga"  
Or, more precisely:  
"He nui rawa te tauwhitinga" (if "tauwhitinga" is accepted for "transaction" in Bitcoin context)  
Or:  
"He rahi rawa te whakawhitinga pūtea"

Recommended:  
"He nui rawa te whakawhitinga"
```

```
        <source>Unable to bind to %s on this computer. %s is probably already running.</source>
        <translation>Kāore e taea te whakakōtuitui ki %s i tēnei rorohiko. E whakapau kē ana te %s e whakahaere ana.</translation>
    
YES  
There are issues with the translation:  
1. "whakakōtuitui" is not the standard term for "bind" in a computing context; "tūhono" or "piri" is more appropriate.  
2. "E whakapau kē ana te %s e whakahaere ana" is ungrammatical and does not accurately translate "is probably already running". "Kei te rere kē te %s" or "Kua tīmata kē pea te %s" would be better.

Correct translation:  
Kāore e taea te tūhono ki %s i tēnei rorohiko. Kua tīmata kē pea te %s.
```

```
        <source>Unknown -blockfilterindex value %s.</source>
        <translation>-He mea kore te -blockfilterindex whiwhi %s.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The phrase "-He mea kore te -blockfilterindex whiwhi %s." is not accurate or idiomatic Māori. "He mea kore" literally means "an absent thing" or "nothing", and "whiwhi" usually means "to receive", which does not fit here. The translation should convey "Unknown" in the sense of "not recognised" or "not known", and keep the flag and the variable in place.

Correct translation:
-Kāore i mōhiotia te uara -blockfilterindex %s.
```

```
        <source>Unknown change type '%s'</source>
        <translation>He whakararuraru, he momo hēhē '%s'</translation>
    
YES
The translation "He whakararuraru, he momo hēhē '%s'" means "A problem, an incorrect type '%s'", which is somewhat imprecise for "Unknown change type '%s'". Also, "whakararuraru" means "problem" or "trouble", which is unnecessary in this context, and "momo hēhē" is better translated as "incorrect type" rather than "unknown type".

A better and more accurate translation would be:
"He momo panoni kāore i mōhiotia '%s'"

Explanation: "momo panoni" for "change type", "kāore i mōhiotia" for "unknown". The format specifier %s is correctly preserved.

Correct translation:
He momo panoni kāore i mōhiotia '%s'
```

```
        <source>Unknown network specified in -onlynet: '%s'</source>
        <translation>He whakamāoritia te tekau whakamāoritanga:
'Unknown network specified in -onlynet: '%s''</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The text in the <translation> tag is not an actual translation to 'mi' (Māori), but instead a meta description saying "He whakamāoritia te tekau whakamāoritanga:" which is unrelated, followed by the untranslated English text. 

Correct translation:
I tautuhia he whatunga kāore i mōhiotia ki te -onlynet: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Unknown new rules activated (versionbit %i)</source>
        <translation>He whakapau kaha hōu kua whakakāhoretia (wāhanga %i)</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "Unknown new rules activated (versionbit %i)" as "He whakapau kaha hōu kua whakakāhoretia (wāhanga %i)" is problematic.

Issues:
- "whakapau kaha" usually means "to exert effort" or "hard work", which does not correspond to "rules".
- "kua whakakāhoretia" can mean "have been denied/rejected", not "activated".
- "wāhanga" means "part/section", but in Bitcoin "versionbit" refers to a specific protocol flag, not a general "section".

Correct translation:
He ture hōu kāore i mohiotia kua whakahohehia (versionbit %i)

Explanation:
- "ture hōu" = new rules
- "kāore i mohiotia" = unknown
- "kua whakahohehia" = has been activated
- Keep "versionbit" as is, since it is a technical term.
```

```
        <source>Verifying blocks…</source>
        <translation>Whakamāramatia ngā paraka...</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Whakamāramatia ngā paraka..." is inaccurate. "Whakamāramatia" means "explain" or "make clear," not "verify." The correct translation for "Verifying blocks…" in Māori should use "whakaū" (to confirm, verify) or "whakamana" (to validate). Also, the source uses an ellipsis (…) not three dots (...).

Correct translation:
"Kei te whakaū i ngā paraka…"
```

```
        <source>Verifying wallet(s)…</source>
        <translation>Whakamātau i te wharepukapuka...</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "wallet(s)" as "wharepukapuka" is incorrect; "wharepukapuka" means "library" in Māori, not "wallet". The ellipsis should also be the same character as in the source (using … instead of ...), unless the Māori language conventionally uses three dots.

A more appropriate Māori translation for "wallet" (in the context of digital or Bitcoin wallets) is "pūkau" or "pūkete" (which means "account", and is sometimes used in technical contexts), but Māori does not have a fully established term for "wallet" in cryptocurrency. For now, "pūkete" is often used.

Correct translation:
Whakamātau ana i ngā pūkete…
```

```
        <source>Wallet needed to be rewritten: restart %s to complete</source>
        <translation>Me whakakore i te whare moni: whakamatau i te %s hei whakakore i te whakamutunga</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate. The original means that the wallet must be rewritten and instructs to restart the application (%s) to complete the process. The translation instead uses "Me whakakore" (must cancel/delete) and mentions "whakamatau" (try) and repeats "whakakore" (cancel) with "whakamutunga" (end/finish), which distorts the meaning.

A correct translation would be:
Me tuhi anō i te pūkete: tīmata anō i te %s kia oti ai

This maintains the instruction to rewrite the wallet and restart the application to finish.
