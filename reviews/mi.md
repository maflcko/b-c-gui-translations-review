        <translation>Tikiake matau ki te whakamāori i te kupu whakamāoritanga:
Right-click to edit address or label</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and contains extraneous text. The correct translation should be:
Tikiake matau ki te whakarerekē i te wāhitau, kuputohu rānei

        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>Mukua te whiriwhiri i te wāhitau kua whiriwhirihia i te rārangi</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it is completely inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of the original English text. The word "Mukua" in the translation means "destroy" or "ruin" in Maori, which is the opposite of "delete". The correct translation should be "Kōhoretia te wāhitau kua tohua i te rārangi".

NO

        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Whakapau kaha te raraunga i te whārangi o nāianei ki tētahi kōnae</translation>
    
YES. The translation does not convey the intended meaning. The source text is about exporting data to a file, whereas the provided translation uses words that mean "exert effort" and "effortfully".

The correct translation should be: "Kaweake te raraunga kei roto i te ripa o naianei ki tētahi konae".
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Ko ēnei ngā whakamāoritanga mō ō whakamahi Bitcoin hei tuku moni. Tirohia i te moni me te wāhi whiwhi i mua i te tuku i ngā moni.</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "whakamāoritanga" (translations) is used instead of "addresses". The correct translation for "addresses" in this context would be "wāhi".

NO
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</source>
        <translation>Ko ēnei ngā whakamāoritanga mō ō whakaaetanga Bitcoin hei whiwhi utu. Whakamahi i te pātene 'Waihanga whakaaronga hōu' i te pae whiwhi ki te whakapūmau i ngā whakaaronga hōu.
Ko te whakakī i ēnei whakaaronga e taea ana anake ki ngā whakararuraru o te momo 'tawhito'.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it misinterprets several key terms related to Bitcoin. The term "addresses" is translated as "whakamāoritanga" (translations), which is incorrect. It should refer to actual Bitcoin addresses. Similarly, "payments" is translated as "whakaaetanga" (agreements or permissions), which is not the correct term for monetary payments. "Signing" is translated as "whakakī" (filling in) and "addresses" is again mistranslated as "whakaaronga" (thoughts or considerations), further distorting the meaning. The word "legacy" is also mistranslated as "tawhito" (old or ancient) instead of a term that conveys the technical meaning of the legacy address type in Bitcoin.

Here is a corrected translation:

NO. The translation is unproblematic.
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Tātari  Tapanga </translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because "Tātari" means "filter" which is not the correct translation for "Copy". The correct translation for "Copy" in this context is "Kape". Also, there is an unnecessary space between "Tātari" and "Tapanga".
Correct translation: Kape Tapanga
```

```
        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>I whakapā atu i te hapa i te whakaputa i te rārangi wāhitau ki %1. Whakamātau anō, koa.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not accurately convey the meaning of the English source text. The phrase "I whakapā atu i te hapa i te whakaputa i te rārangi wāhitau ki" translates to something like "I contacted the error in producing the address list to", which is nonsensical in this context. A more accurate translation would be "I roto i te hapa i te tiaki i te rārangi wāhitau ki %1. Whakamātau anō." which means "There was an error saving the address list to %1. Please try again."
```

```
        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Kore te whakapau kore</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The Maori translation is a literal translation of "Exporting Failed" but it doesn't make sense in the context of Bitcoin. The correct translation should be something like "Kua rahua te whakaputa" which means "Exporting has failed".

Kore te whakapau kore
Kua rahua te whakaputa
```

        <source>This operation needs your wallet passphrase to unlock the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Kia whakapiri tēnei mahi ki tō whakapuaki moni hei whakawhiti i te whare moni.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is not accurate and is problematic. It misinterprets "operation" as "Kia whakapiri tēnei mahi" (This work attaches) and "wallet passphrase" as "whakapiki tō whakapuaki moni" (increase your money statement). Additionally, "unlock the wallet" is incorrectly translated as "whakawhiti i te whare moni" (exchange the money house).

The correct translation should convey the meaning of needing a passphrase to unlock the wallet.

Correct translation: Me tono tēnei mahi ki tō kupuhipa pēke kia whakawātea ai te pēke.

YES: The translation incorrectly translates "your" as "ou". The correct translation should be "ō" or "ōu" depending on whether it is singular or plural, but in this context, it should be "ō".

Correct translation: Whakatūpato: Ki te whakakino i tō pēke moni me te ngaro i tō kupuhipa, ka &lt;b&gt;NGARO KATOA Ō PĪNIHA BITCOIN&lt;/b&gt;!
```

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?</source>
        <translation>Kei te whakapau kaha koe ki te whakakino i to whare moni?</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin encryption. It translates to "Are you making an effort to corrupt your money house?"

The correct translation should be something like: "Kei te tino hiahia koe ki te whakamuna i to putea?" which means "Do you really want to encrypt your wallet?"
```

```
        <source>Wallet encrypted</source>
        <translation>Whakakorengia te wharetaonga</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "wharetaonga" means "museum" in Maori. The correct translation for "wallet" in this context is "pukoro".

The correct translation is:
Wallet encrypted
<translation>Kua pūmau te pukoro</translation>
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>

YES. The translation has errors and is missing a format specifier. The phrase "ten or more random characters" is translated as "tekau, neke atu ranei nga tohu matapōkere 2", which includes an extraneous "2". The phrase "eight or more words" is translated as "waru neke atu ranei nga kupu 3", which includes an extraneous "3". The formatting for "ten or more random characters" and "eight or more words" also seems to be incorrect, missing the bold formatting.

Correct translation: Whakauruhia te kīangahipa hou mo te putea. Whakamahia he kupu huna kia <b >tekau, neke atu rānei ngā tohu matapōkere</b>, otirā <b >waru, neke atu rānei ngā kupu</b>.

        <translation>Whakauru te kupu whakapākehā me te kupu hōu mō te pēke moni.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "pēke moni" which means "money bag" or "piggy bank" in Māori, not "wallet". The correct translation for wallet in this context is "pukoro".

NO - Whakauru te kupu whakapākehā me te kupu hōu mō te pukoro.
```

```
        <source>Remember that encrypting your wallet cannot fully protect your bitcoins from being stolen by malware infecting your computer.</source>
        <translation>Mahara kia whakakorehia te whakakino i ō wharepukapuka kia whakararuraru i ō wharepūkoro.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The word "encrypting" is translated as "whakakorehia te whakakino" which means "disabling the malware". The phrase "protect your bitcoins" is translated as " whakararuraru i ō wharepūkoro" which means "disturb your computers". The correct translation should be: "Mahara kia kaua te whakamunatia o koutou pukapuka ki te tiaki i a koutou mōrearea i te tahae mō te rorohiko kua pangia e te koe".
```

```

```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Kei te whakakorehia tō pēke moni.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect and conveys the opposite meaning of the original English text. The English text states the wallet is *about to be encrypted*, whereas the translation states the wallet is *being decrypted*.
Kei te whakakōtuituihia tō pēke moni.
```

```
        <source>IMPORTANT: Any previous backups you have made of your wallet file should be replaced with the newly generated, encrypted wallet file. For security reasons, previous backups of the unencrypted wallet file will become useless as soon as you start using the new, encrypted wallet.</source>
        <translation>HEMENGĀ: Me whakakapi ngā tāruarau i mua i te whakaputa i te kōnae pēke whakamahi kē o tō wharemoni ki te kōnae pēke hōu, whakakapi. Hei ētahi take whakamarumaru, ka whakakore ngā tāruarau i mua i te kōnae pēke kore whakakapi, ka whiwhi whakamahi i te kōnae pēke hōu, whakakapi.</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "HEMENGĀ" is not a standard Māori word and seems to be a mistranslation of "IMPORTANT". Additionally, the phrase "Me whakakapi ngā tāruarau i mua i te whakaputa i te kōnae pēke whakamahi kē o tō wharemoni ki te kōnae pēke hōu, whakakapi" is grammatically awkward and doesn't clearly convey the intended meaning. A better translation for the entire sentence is:

"WHAKAMAHI: Me whakakapi ngā tārua katoa o tō kōnae pēke i mua ki te kōnae pēke kua whakaputa hou, kua whakakōputaputahia hoki. Nā te haumaru, kāore e whai kiko ngā tārua o mua o te kōnae pēke kāore anō kia whakakōputaputahia i te wā e tīmata ai koe ki te whakamahi i te kōnae pēke hou kua whakakōputaputahia."
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed</source>
        <translation>Kati te whakamātau i te whakakorenga wharetaonga</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The English phrase "Wallet encryption failed" means that the process of encrypting the wallet did not succeed. The provided translation "Kati te whakamātau i te whakakorenga wharetaonga" means "Stop trying to remove the wallet".
The correct translation should be: "Kua rahua te pūruatia te pēke"
```

```
        <source>Wallet unlock failed</source>
        <translation>Kati te whakakore i te whakatuwhera o te whareparakau</translation>
    
YES - The translation is nonsensical and does not convey the meaning of the original English text. The word "Kati" means "stop" or "end", and the rest of the phrase translates to something like "stop the unlocking of the fortress". The correct translation for "Wallet unlock failed" in Māori is "Kua rahua te whakatuwhera putea".
Kua rahua te whakatuwhera putea
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>Ko te kupuhipa i whakauruhia mō te whakapau kōnae whakamāhukihuki, he hē.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and doesn't convey the original meaning. The term "whakapau kōnae whakamāhukihuki" doesn't accurately translate to "wallet decryption".

Correct translation: Ko te kupuhipo i kuhia kia iriti ai te putea kaore i te tika.
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character. If this is successful, please set a new passphrase to avoid this issue in the future.</source>
        <translation>Ko te kupu whakapā atu i whakauruhia mō te whakapau kōnae kore tika. Kei roto i te kupu whakapā he pūāhua kore (hei tauira - he tūmomo kore). Ki te whakapau kōnae te kupu whakapā i te wā i whakatūria ai tēnei whakamahi i mua i te 25.0, whakamātau anō ki te whakapau kōnae ki te whakakore i tēnei raruraru i te wā e whai ake nei.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and omits crucial information from the original English text. Specifically, it fails to mention the instruction to only use characters up to, but not including, the first null character if the passphrase was set with a version prior to 25.0. It also omits the suggestion to set a new passphrase to avoid future issues.

Correct translation: "Ko te kupuhipa i whakaurua mo te wetewete putea kaore i te tika. Kei roto i te kupuhipa te kirifika kore (ara - he paita zero). Mena i whakatauhia te kupuhipa me te putanga o tenei rorohiko i mua i te 25.0, tena koa ngana ano me nga kirifika anake tae noa ki - engari kaore i tae ki - te kirifika kore tuatahi. Mena ka angitu tenei, tena koa whakatauhia he kupuhipa hou kia kore ai e puta tenei raru a muri ake nei."
```

```
        <source>Passphrase change failed</source>
        <translation>Kua whakapau kē te whakarerekē i te kupu whakapākehā.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and doesn't accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The phrase "Kua whakapau kē te whakarerekē i te kupu whakapākehā" translates to "The passphrase change has already been made," which is not the intended meaning of "Passphrase change failed."

A more accurate translation would be: "I rahua te whakarerekē o te kupuhipa."
```

```
        <source>The old passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character.</source>
        <translation>Ko te kupuhipa tawhito i whakauruhia mō te whakamāori i te wharetaonga he hē. Kei roto i te kupuhipa tētahi pūāhua kore (hei tauira - he tīmatanga kore). Ki te whakaritea te kupuhipa ki te whakamahi i tētahi wāhanga o tēnei wharepukapuka i mua i te 25.0, whakamātau anō ki te whakamahi anō me ngā pūāhua ki te — engari kāore i whakauruhia — te pūāhua tuatahi kore.</translation>
    
YES, the translation has a phrasing issue. The phrase "he tīmatanga kore" is a literal translation of "a zero byte" but it is not idiomatic or clear in the context. It should be translated as "he paititi kore" or "he paititi zero".

NO, the translation is otherwise accurate and poses no other issues.

The correct translation is:
"Ko te kupuhipa tawhito i whakauruhia mō te whakamāori i te wharetaonga he hē. Kei roto i te kupuhipa tētahi pūāhua kore (hei tauira - he paititi kore). Ki te whakaritea te kupuhipa ki te whakamahi i tētahi wāhanga o tēnei wharepukapuka i mua i te 25.0, whakamātau anō ki te whakamahi anō me ngā pūāhua ki te — engari kāore i whakauruhia — te pūāhua tuatahi kore."
```

```
        <source>IP/Netmask</source>
        <translation>IP/NetmaskIP/Netmask</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains duplicate text "IP/NetmaskIP/Netmask". The correct translation is "IP/Netmask".
```

```
        <source>Settings file %1 might be corrupt or invalid.</source>
        <translation>Settings file %1 me whakapōrearea, me whakararuraru rānei.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The Maori translation uses words that mean "may be disturbed or troubled" instead of "corrupt or invalid."

The correct translation should be:
Settings file %1 me pirau, me kore rānei.</translation>
```

```
        <source>Runaway exception</source>
        <translation>Tūkino whakawhiti</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of "Runaway exception". In the context of Bitcoin, a "runaway exception" would likely refer to an unhandled error or an exception that is causing a program to behave erratically. The provided translation, "Tūkino whakawhiti", seems to be in Māori and translates to something closer to "damaging exchange" or "corrupt exchange", which is not relevant.

A more appropriate translation would depend on the specific technical context, but common terms for exceptions in computing are:

*   "Pāia whakawhiti" (Exception error)
*   "Whakatārewa whakawhiti" (Suspended exception)

Given the context of Bitcoin and programming, a more fitting translation might be:

**Correct Translation:** Pāia whakawhiti
```

```
        <source>A fatal error occurred. %1 can no longer continue safely and will quit.</source>
        <translation>I whakararuraru mate. Ka whakakore %1 i te whakararuraru haumaru, ka whakakore hoki.</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses the word "whakakore" twice with different meanings, leading to an awkward and slightly nonsensical sentence. Additionally, the first instance of "whakakore" should mean "quit" or "terminate," not "cancel" or "eliminate."

The corrected translation should be:
"I whakararuraru mate. Kaore e taea e %1 te haere tonu i runga i te haumaru ka kati."
```

```
        <source>Internal error</source>
        <translation>Hapa whaiaro</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses an incorrect word for "internal". The word "whaiaro" means "self" or "personal" in Maori, which is not the correct translation for "internal" in this context. The correct translation for "internal" in Maori is "roto".

Correct translation: Hapa roto
```

```
        <source>An internal error occurred. %1 will attempt to continue safely. This is an unexpected bug which can be reported as described below.</source>
        <translation>Kua puta he hapa ā-roto. Ka whakamātau a %1 ki te whakarite i te whakararuraru i te āhua haere tonu. He hē whakararuraru tēnei e whakapātaitia ana i raro i te whakamārama i raro nei.</translation>
    
YES - The translation contains a significant grammatical error and awkward phrasing. The phrase "ki te whakarite i te whakararuraru i te āhua haere tonu" translates to "to arrange the disturbance in the way of continuing," which is not what the original English means. The English "will attempt to continue safely" implies an effort to proceed without further issues, not to manage an existing disturbance.

Correct translation: Kua puta he hapa ā-roto. Ka whakamātau a %1 ki te haere tonu me te kore raru. He hē whakararuraru tēnei ka taea te pūwhiria i raro i te whakamārama i raro nei.
```

```
        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Kore te whakapau kore</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The Maori translation is a literal translation of "Exporting Failed" but it doesn't make sense in the context of Bitcoin. The correct translation should be something like "Kua rahua te whakaputa" which means "Exporting has failed".

Kore te whakapau kore
Kua rahua te whakaputa
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Whakapau kaha te raraunga i te whārangi o nāianei ki tētahi kōnae</translation>
    
YES. The translation does not convey the intended meaning. The source text is about exporting data to a file, whereas the provided translation uses words that mean "exert effort" and "effortfully".

The correct translation should be: "Kaweake te raraunga kei roto i te ripa o naianei ki tētahi konae".
```

```
        <source>Input not found or already spent</source>
        <translation>Kāore i kitea te urupare, kua whiwhi i mua, kua whiwhi rānei.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and uses overly complex phrasing. The word "Input" in the context of Bitcoin refers to a transaction input, not an "urupare" (response/reply). Additionally, the phrase "kua whiwhi i mua, kua whiwhi rānei" translates to "already received, or received".

A more accurate and concise translation would be:

Kāore i kitea te whakauru, kua whakapāho kē kē, kāore rānei.</translation>
```

```
        <source>Insufficient dbcache for block verification</source>
        <translation>Kore rawa i te nui te dbcache mō te whakamātau i te paraka</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "paraka" in Māori means "pig" or "pork". The correct word for "block" in the context of Bitcoin is "poraka".

NO
```

```
        <source>Invalid -i2psam address or hostname: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Kore whakaaetanga -i2psam wāhitau rite, ingoa wāhi: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation of "Invalid" to "Kore whakaaetanga" is incorrect. "Kore whakaaetanga" means "no agreement" or "unauthorized", whereas "Invalid" means not valid or incorrect. The correct translation for "Invalid" in this context would be "Tārewa" or "Pāhure".

UNK_LANG - I am not familiar with the language specified by 'mi'.
```

```
        <source>Invalid -onion address or hostname: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Kore whakaaetanga -onion wāhitau, ingoa ranei: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses an incorrect Māori word for "invalid". The correct word is "kore mana" or "hē".

Correct translation: Kore mana -onion wāhitau, ingoa ranei: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Invalid -proxy address or hostname: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Kore whakaaetanga -proxy wāhitau ranei ingoa whare: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate. It translates "Invalid" as "Kore whakaaetanga", which means "unacceptable" or "unauthorised" rather than "invalid".

The correct translation should be:

Invalid -proxy address or hostname: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Invalid P2P permission: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Invalid P2P whakaaetanga: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation of 'permission' to ' whakaaetanga' appears to be incorrect. Based on the context of Bitcoin P2P networks, 'permission' should likely be translated to a term related to authorization or access. A more appropriate translation would be 'tūruatanga' or 'pōuri'.

Correct translation: Invalid P2P tūruatanga: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Invalid amount for %s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' (must be at least %s)</source>
        <translation>He whakararuraru te whiwhinga mō %s = &lt;amount&gt;: '%s' (me whakarite i te mea atu i te %s)</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and grammatically incorrect in the target language. The word "whakararuraru" means "troubled" or "disturbed", which is not the correct translation for "invalid". The phrase "me whakarite i te mea atu i te" translates to "must be more than", which is a literal translation of "at least", but it doesn't sound natural and is grammatically awkward.

A more accurate and natural translation would be: "Kāore e tika ana te nui mō %s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' (me nui atu i te %s)" or "Kāore e tika ana te moni mō %s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' (me nui atu i te %s)".

- **Correct translation:** Kāore e tika ana te nui mō %s=&lt;amount&gt;: '%s' (me nui atu i te %s)
```

```
        <source>Invalid netmask specified in -whitelist: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Kua whakapau kaha te netmask kore whaimana i whakarārangi i roto i te -whitelist: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The phrase "Kua whakapau kaha te" translates to "has worked hard" which is completely irrelevant to the context of a netmask.

Correct translation: He kohiko kore tautoko te netmask i tohua ki te -whitelist: '%s'

        <source>Invalid pre-selected input %s</source>
        <translation>Kāore i te tika te kōwhiri i tātari i te urupare %s</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and the meaning is not preserved. The English phrase "Invalid pre-selected input %s" translates to "Kāore i te tika te kōwhiri i tātari i te urupare %s" which translates back to something like "Invalid choose filter response %s".

A more accurate translation would be: "Kāore i te tika te whakauru i tō kōwhiri" or "He he te whakauru i tō kōwhiri"

        <source>Listening for incoming connections failed (listen returned error %s)</source>
        <translation>Whakararuraru ana te whakarongo i ngā hononga e haere mai ana (kua whakahokia te hapa %s)</translation>
    
YES - The translation appears to be attempting to convey that listening for incoming connections failed, but the phrasing is awkward and does not accurately reflect the technical meaning in the context of Bitcoin. The word "whakararuraru" translates to "disturbed" or "troubled," which isn't the correct way to describe a failed listening operation. The phrase "kua whakahokia te hapa" translates to "the error has been returned," which is also not the most natural or accurate way to express the source sentence.

A more accurate translation would be:

"Kua rahua te whakarongo ki ngā hononga ka tae mai (kua hoki mai te hapa %s)"
```

```
        <source>Loading P2P addresses…</source>
        <translation>Whakararuraru P2P addresses ...</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the word "Whakararuraru" in the Mi'kmaq language means "trouble" or "disruption," which is not an accurate translation of "Loading." A more appropriate translation would convey the idea of loading or preparing the addresses.

NO
```

        <source>Loading banlist…</source>
        <translation>Whakararuraru ana, ka whakapau kaha ki te whakamāori i te kupu whakamāoritanga.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of the source text. The source text means "Loading banlist…" which is a process of loading a list of banned items or users. The provided translation seems to be a generic error message or a placeholder that does not relate to the context of Bitcoin or banlists.

Correct translation: **Te uta i te rarangi aukati…**

```

```
        <source>Loading wallet…</source>
        <translation>Whakararuraru pūtea...</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "Whakararuraru pūtea" means "Wallet troubled" or "Wallet confused" in Maori, which is not an accurate translation for "Loading wallet…".

The correct translation should be something like "Te utanga putea..." which means "Loading wallet...".

NO

        <translation>Kua ngaro ngā raraunga whakatikatika mō te whakarite i te rahi whakaritenga whakawhiti</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "whakatikatika" means "correction" or "fixing", which does not accurately convey the meaning of "solving" in the context of estimating transaction size. The correct term should refer to data needed for estimation or calculation.

Correct translation: Kua ngaro ngā raraunga whakatau tata mō te whakarite i te rahi whakaritenga whakawhiti

        <translation>Me whakarite i tētahi pōti me te -whitebind: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect. It uses "Me whakarite" which translates to "arrange" or "set up" rather than "Specify". The correct translation for "specify" in this context would be "Tohua".

NO
```

```
        <source>Rescanning…</source>
        <translation>Whakarerekētia...</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and uses a word that means "change" in the context of a Bitcoin transaction, rather than "rescanning". The correct translation for "Rescanning…" in the context of Bitcoin is "Taki ano...".
Whakarerekētia...

        <translation>SQLiteDatabase: Kua whakakorehia te whakahaere i te kōrero hei whakamana i te papakupu: %s</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The word "kua whakakorehia" means "has been canceled" or "has been rejected", which is not equivalent to "Failed".

The correct translation should be:
SQLiteDatabase: I rahua te whakahaere i te korero hei whakamana i te papakupu: %s

```

        <translation>SQLiteDatabase: Kua whakakorehia te whakarite i te kupu hei whakamāmā i te papakupu: %s</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic because "Kua whakakorehia te whakarite i te kupu hei whakamāmā i te papakupu" means "The statement to clarify the dictionary has been rejected," which is an inaccurate translation of "Failed to prepare statement to verify database."

Correct translation: SQLiteDatabase: I rahua te whakarite i te korero hei manatoko i te papaaarangi: %s

        <translation>SQLiteDatabase: Kua whakapau kaha te pānui i te hapa whakamātau o te papamahi: %s</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The word "kua whakapau kaha" means "has worked hard" or "has strived", which is not relevant to the context of an error in reading a database. The correct translation should convey the idea of a failure to read.

NO
```

        <source>SQLiteDatabase: Unexpected application id. Expected %u, got %u</source>
        <translation>SQLiteDatabase: Tino whakararuraru te tuhinga whakamahi. Tūpono %u, ka whiwhi %u</translation>
    
YES. The translation is inaccurate. The phrase "Tino whakararuraru te tuhinga whakamahi" translates to "The application ID is very troubled/problematic", which does not convey the intended meaning of "Unexpected application id". The phrase "Tūpono %u, ka whiwhi %u" translates to "Unexpected %u, received %u", which is also not quite right, as it should be "Expected %u, received %u".

Correct translation:
SQLiteDatabase: Tāhuhu taupānga kāore i tūmanakohia. I tataria te %u, kua riro te %u

```
        <source>Signing transaction failed</source>
        <translation>Ko te whakakore i te whakauru i te whakaritenga</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of the original English text. The original text "Signing transaction failed" implies an error in the process of signing a Bitcoin transaction. The provided translation appears to be in the Maori language and translates to "The rejection of the introduction of the arrangement," which is unrelated to the context.

Correct translation: Kua rahua te waitohanga tauwhiti.

        <translation>Kāore i te whiwhi i te -walletdir i whakaritea "%s"</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical. The source text means that the specified wallet directory does not exist, but the translation says "Did not receive the specified -walletdir "%s"".

Correct translation: "Kua tohua -walletdir "%s" kāore hoki e noho"
```

```
        <source>Specified -walletdir "%s" is not a directory</source>

YES - The translation is not an accurate reflection of the source text. It translates "does not exist" as "did not receive" which is not equivalent. The correct translation would be "Kāore te whare pūranga raraunga i whakaritea "%s" i te mea kei te noho."

YES - The translation is inaccurate. "%s" should be translated to "mai i te %s" instead of "i te %s". Also, "kōnae pūnaha" means "system file" and not "source code". The correct translation for "source code" is "wātea ana te waehere puna".

The correct translation is: Waehere puna mō te %s.

YES, The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The phrase "i te wā e whakapau kore ana" translates to "at the time of wasting/spending without", which is not the intended meaning of "does not exist".

The correct translation should be: "Kāore te kōnae whirihoranga %s i te noho"

        <translation>Ka whakakore te pōkeka i te utu iti ake i te utu tawhiti i te iti rawa.</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses an incorrect word for "wallet". The correct word is "pēke".
The correct translation is: "Ka whakakore te pēke i te utu iti ake i te utu tawhiti i te iti rawa."
```

```
        <source>This is the minimum transaction fee you pay on every transaction.</source>
        <translation>Ko tēnei te utu whakaritenga iti rawa ka whiwhi koe i ia whakaritenga.</translation>
    
YES: The translation misunderstands the meaning of "transaction fee" and translates it as "transaction". The correct translation should convey the meaning of a fee associated with the transaction.
Ko tēnei te utu whakawhiti iti rawa ka utua e koe i ia whakawhiti.
```

```
        <source>This is the transaction fee you will pay if you send a transaction.</source>
        <translation>Ko te utu whakawhiti tāuta tēnei ka utu e whiwhi ana koe ki te tuku i tētahi tāuta.</translation>
    
YES: The translation incorrectly uses "tāuta" (device/installation) instead of "utu whakawhiti" (transaction fee) when referring to the transaction fee.
Correct translation: Ko te utu whakawhiti tēnei ka utua e koe ki te tuku tauwhitiwhiti.
```

```
        <source>Transaction amounts must not be negative</source>
        <translation>Kāore e whakaaetia ngā moni whakaritenga kia whakararuraru.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The word "whakararuraru" means "complicated" or "troubled", not "negative". The correct translation of "Transaction amounts must not be negative" into Māori is "Kāore e whakaaetia kia tau te nui o ngā whakawhitiwhiti ki raro i te kore."
```

        <translation>He whakawhitiwhitinga whakaputanga hōputu whakararuraru te tūnga</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The word "hōputu" means "format" or "format specifier", which is not present in the source text. The word "whakararuraru" means "troubled" or "complicated", which is also not present in the source text.
The correct translation should be: "He whakawhitiwhitinga whakaputanga hōputu kei waho o te awhe"
```

```
        <source>Transaction must have at least one recipient</source>
        <translation>Me whiwhi whakaritenga tātari tētahi whiwhi whakaritenga ki te kaiwhiwhi kotahi i te minimuma</translation>

```

        <translation>He hiahia te whakarerekē i te whakaritenga whakaritenga, engari kāore e taea e mātou te whakaputa.</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original English text. The word "address" in the context of Bitcoin refers to a specific location where funds can be sent or received. The translation uses "whakaritenga whakaritenga" which translates to "arrangement arrangement" or "system arrangement," failing to capture the specific meaning of a Bitcoin address.

Correct translation:
<translation>E hiahia ana te tauwhitinga ki tetahi wāhitau whakarerekē, engari kāore e taea e mātou te whakaputa.</translation>
```

```
        <source>Transaction too large</source>
        <translation>He whakawhitiwhitinga nui rawa te whakapau kaha</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The original phrase "Transaction too large" means that the transaction is too big in size, but the translation means "The transaction is too large and exhausting", which adds extra meaning that is not in the original text.

The correct translation would be: "Nui rawa te whakawhitiwhiti"
```

        <translation>Kāore e taea te whakakōtuitui ki %s i tēnei rorohiko. E whakapau kē ana te %s e whakahaere ana.</translation>
    
YES, The translation incorrectly uses "E whakapau kē ana te %s e whakahaere ana" which translates to "The %s that is running is probably already spending". The original English states that the program is *already running*, not *spending*. The correct translation should reflect that the program is already in execution.

Correct translation: Kāore e taea te whakakōtuitui ki %s i tēnei rorohiko. Kei te whakahaere kē te %s.
```

```
        <source>Unable to unload the wallet before migrating</source>
        <translation>Kāore e taea te whakakore i te whareparakore i mua i te whakawhiti.</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "whareparakore" is not a recognized word in Māori. The source text translates to "Unable to unload the wallet before migrating." The provided translation seems to be attempting to convey a similar meaning, but the word choice for "wallet" is incorrect.

A more appropriate translation for "wallet" in this context would be "pēke" or "pūkete," depending on the nuance. However, given the technical context of Bitcoin, it's possible that a more direct transliteration or a neologism might be used in some contexts. Without more context on how "wallet" is typically handled in technical Māori translations, it's difficult to be definitive.

However, the current translation uses an incorrect word.

Correct translation: Kāore e taea te whakakore i te **pēke** i mua i te whakawhiti.
Or: Kāore e taea te whakakore i te **pūkete** i mua i te whakawhiti.
```

```
        <source>Unknown -blockfilterindex value %s.</source>
        <translation>-He mea kore te -blockfilterindex whiwhi %s.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and unnatural. The phrase "He mea kore te" is not a standard way to express "Unknown" in this context in Māori.

Correct translation: -He kore noa te uara o -blockfilterindex %s.
```

```
        <source>Unknown address type '%s'</source>
        <translation>He aha te momo wāhitau kore mō '%s'</translation>
    
YES, The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning of the source text. The phrase "He aha te momo wāhitau kore mō '%s'" translates to "What is the unknown address type for '%s'", which is a question and not an informative statement. The correct translation should state that the address type is unknown.

NO
```

```
        <source>Unknown change type '%s'</source>
        <translation>He whakararuraru, he momo hēhē '%s'</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The word "He whakararuraru" means "Disturbance" or "Trouble" in Māori, which is not the correct translation for "Unknown" in this context. The word "he" before "momo hēhē" is also redundant.
The correct translation should be: Unknown change type '%s' -> Momo hē o te panoni '%s'
```

```
        <source>Unknown network specified in -onlynet: '%s'</source>
        <translation>He whakamāoritia te tekau whakamāoritanga:

YES: The translation is not a translation of the source text. The provided text appears to be a placeholder indicating that a translation is needed, not the actual translation.
Unknown network specified in -onlynet: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Unknown new rules activated (versionbit %i)</source>
        <translation>He whakapau kaha hōu kua whakakāhoretia (wāhanga %i)</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "He whakapau kaha" translates to "effort" or "strong effort" in Māori, which is not the correct translation for "Unknown new rules activated". The word "whakapau" can mean to expend or spend, but in this context it's used incorrectly. The word "hōu" means "new", but it should be modifying "rules", not "effort". Also, the word "whakakāhoretia" means "canceled" or "annulled", which is not what "activated" means.

A more accurate translation would be:

He ture hou kaore ano kia mohiotia kua whakahohehia (wāhanga %i)

This translates to: "Unknown new rules have been activated (versionbit %i)".

        <translation>Te korero a te kaihoko (%s) e whakararuraru ana i ngā tohu kore whakapau kaha.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the Māori phrase "ngā tohu kore whakapau kaha" translates to "unsafe characters" which is not accurate. The original English phrase "unsafe characters" refers to characters that are not permitted in a user agent comment according to Bitcoin protocol.

Correct translation: "Te korero a te kaihoko (%s) kei roto ngā tūāhuatanga tē taea te whakamahi."
```

```
        <source>Verifying blocks…</source>

YES, The translation is inaccurate. The source text "Verifying blocks…" means checking the validity of blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain, while the translated text "Whakamāramatia ngā paraka..." means "Explaining the blocks...".

Correct translation: "Te manatoko i ngā poraka…"
```

        <translation>Me whakakore i te whare moni: whakamatau i te %s hei whakakore i te whakamutunga</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical. It translates "Wallet needed to be rewritten" to "Me whakakore i te whare moni" which means "The wallet needs to be removed". It also translates "restart %s to complete" to "whakamatau i te %s hei whakakore i te whakamutunga" which means "try %s to cancel the last one". A more accurate translation would be "Me tuhia anō te pēke: tīmata anō te %s hei whakaoti".
