The translation is not in 'mi' (Māori). It contains English and an unrelated instruction in Māori about translation but does not translate the source text.

Correct translation:
Pāwhiritia-matau hei whakatika i te wāhitau, te tapanga rānei

ERR
The translation is problematic. "Whakapau kaha" means "to exert effort," which is incorrect for "export." The rest of the translation is also not accurate. The correct translation for "Export the data in the current tab to a file" in Māori ('mi') should be:

Tukua atu ngā raraunga i te ripa onāianei ki tētahi kōnae

ERR
The translation is somewhat inaccurate and may mislead. The English source refers to "your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments", but the translation uses "ngā whakamāoritanga mō ō whakamahi Bitcoin" which translates as "these are the translations for your use of Bitcoin." Also, "whakamāoritanga" means "translation", which is incorrect here. The rest paraphrases but is not precise.

Correct translation:
Ko ēnei ōu wāhitau Bitcoin mō te tuku utu. Me mātua tirotiro i te moni me te wāhitau whiwhi i mua i te tuku moni.

Ko te whakakī i ēnei whakaaronga e taea ana anake ki ngā whakararuraru o te momo 'tawhito'.</translation>
    
ERR
The translation contains several errors and inaccuracies, and does not closely reflect the intended meaning of the source, particularly with respect to technical terms such as "address", "receiving", "signing", and "legacy". For example:
- "whakamāoritanga" means 'translations', which is incorrect for 'addresses'.
- "whakaaetanga" means 'permissions', incorrect for 'addresses'.
- "Whakamahi i te pātene 'Waihanga whakaaronga hōu' i te pae whiwhi ki te whakapūmau i ngā whakaaronga hōu." mistranslates "receiving address" (here, "whakaaronga" is not a valid translation for "address" in this context).
- "Ko te whakakī i ēnei whakaaronga e taea ana anake ki ngā whakararuraru o te momo 'tawhito'." uses "whakararuraru" (troubles/problems) for "addresses" and "signing", which is not correct.

Correct translation:
Ko ēnei ō wāhitau Bitcoin hei whiwhi utu. Hei waihanga i tētahi wāhitau whiwhinga hōu, whakamahia te pātene 'Waihanga wāhitau whiwhinga hōu' i te ripa whiwhi.
Ka taea te taki mā ngā wāhitau momo 'legacy' anake.

Explanation:
- "Wāhitau" is widely used for "address" (as in network or wallet addresses).
- "Whiwhinga" references "receiving" meaningfully here.
- "Taki" (sign) or "hainatanga" (signing) for the action of "signing".
- The technical term "legacy" is kept in quotes as per convention.
- All format specifiers are preserved (though none are in this source).
- No significant whitespace issues exist in the corrected translation.

The Māori word "Tātari" means "filter" or "sort," not "copy." The correct translation for "Copy &Label" should use the Māori word for "copy," which is "Tārua." The ampersand is present once, which is correct, but there is a stray space at the end of the translation that should be removed.

Correct translation:

The translation is problematic. The phrase "Kia whakapiri tēnei mahi ki tō whakapuaki moni hei whakawhiti i te whare moni." is not an accurate rendering of the original. "Whakapuaki moni" does not directly refer to "passphrase" (it suggests "declare money" or "utter money"), and "whare moni" is better for "bank" rather than "wallet" in this technical context.

Correct translation:

ERR
The translation is problematic. "Kei te whakapau kaha koe ki te whakakino i to whare moni?" means "Are you making an effort to damage your wallet?", which is incorrect. Additionally, "whakakino" means "to harm" or "to abuse", not "to encrypt". A better translation for "encrypt" would be "whakaū-kupuhipa" (to password protect or encrypt), and "whare moni" is a reasonable translation for "wallet".

Correct translation:
Kei te tino hiahia koe ki te whakamuna i tō whare moni?

The translation is incorrect. The source "Wallet encrypted" means that the wallet has been secured with encryption. The translation "Whakakorengia te wharetaonga" means "Delete the wallet" or "Remove the wallet", which is not accurate and could be misleading.

Correct translation:

ERR
The translation contains several inaccuracies and formatting issues:

1. "kīangahipa" is not a common or correct term for "passphrase" in Māori; "kupu huna" or similar would be more accurate.
2. The sentence omits the HTML tags (&lt;br/&gt; and &lt;b&gt;) from the source, which may affect formatting.
3. The numbers as written ("2, 3 waru neke atu") seem to be a mistranslation and are confusing.
4. The translation does not mention "ten or more random characters" or "eight or more words" correctly.

Correct translation:
Whakauruhia te kupu huna hou mō te putea.&lt;br/&gt;Tēnā, whakamahia he kupu huna kei roto he &lt;b&gt;tekau, neke atu rānei, o ngā pūāhua matapōkere&lt;/b&gt;, ā, &lt;b&gt>waru, neke atu rānei, o ngā kupu&lt;/b&gt;.

ERR
The translation incorrectly renders "passphrase" as "kupu whakapākehā," which means "English word/phrase" rather than "passphrase" (a password or secret phrase). Also, "pēke moni" means "money bag" or "bank", not specifically a "wallet" in the Bitcoin context, which is better translated as "pūkete" or "pūtea".

Correct translation:
Whakaurua te kupuhipa tawhito me te kupuhipa hōu mō te pūkete.

        <translation>Mahara kia whakakorehia te whakakino i ō wharepukapuka kia whakararuraru i ō wharepūkoro.</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is problematic. The 'mi' (Māori) translation does not accurately reflect the original meaning and introduces errors. For example, "whakakorehia te whakakino" means "removing the damage", and "wharepukapuka" means "book/library", not "wallet". Furthermore, the concepts of "encrypting", "protect", "stealing", and "malware" are not adequately or accurately covered.

Correct translation:
Mahara, ahakoa ka whakamuna koe i tō pūkoro, kāore e taea te ārai katoa i āu bitcoin kia kore e tāhaetia e te rorohiko kino ka pangia tō rorohiko.

(Note: This version preserves appropriate context and meaning while using suitable Māori terms for 'wallet' (pūkoro), 'encrypt' (whakamuna), 'malware' (rorohiko kino), and 'bitcoins'.)

Explanation:
"Whakamuna" means "to encrypt" in Māori, and "pūkete" is a more standard word for "wallet" in this context.

The original English refers to encrypting the wallet, not deleting it. The correct translation of "Your wallet is about to be encrypted." to Te Reo Māori ('mi') should mention encryption, not deletion.

Correct translation:

ERR
The translation is problematic: it mistranslates critical terms, resulting in a confusing and inaccurate interpretation. The term "wallet file" is inconsistently and incorrectly handled as "kōnae pēke" (bank file), rather than a direct loan or contextualized equivalent (e.g., "kōnae pūrere pūtea" or "kōnae wāreti"). The use of "whakakapi" (replace) and the overall structure is awkward and loses crucial information and clarity from the source. There is confusion between encrypted and unencrypted versions, and terms like "whakakore" (remove/abolish) do not clearly reflect "useless". "Whiwhi whakamahi" (get use) is also inaccurate for "using" a file.

Correct translation:
HE PĀNUI NUI: Me whakakapi ngā tārua o mua o tō kōnae wāreti ki te kōnae wāreti hōu kua whakamunatia. Mō ngā take haumaru, ka kore e whai hua ngā tārua o mua o te kōnae wāreti kāore i whakamunatia inā tīmata koe ki te whakamahi i te kōnae wāreti hōu kua whakamunatia.

The translation is inaccurate. The source text "Wallet encryption failed" means "The encryption of the wallet did not succeed." However, the translation says "Kati te whakamātau i te whakakorenga wharetaonga", which translates to "Stop the attempt at the deletion of the warehouse/treasury", and is both semantically and lexically incorrect.

There is an issue with the translation:
1. "kupuhipa" is correct for "passphrase".
2. However, "whakapau kōnae whakamāhukihuki" does not correctly convey "wallet decryption". "Whakapau" can mean "to use up", "kōnae" is "file", and "whakamāhukihuki" does not appear to be a correct term in Māori, especially for "decrypt".
3. It should refer to "pūkete" (wallet) and use a clearer phrase for "decryption" such as "whakapakaru i te huna kupu" ("unlock", "decryption") or "whakatuwhera" (open/unlock).

Correct translation:
Ko te kupuhipa i whakauruhia hei wetewete i te pūkete he hē.

ERR
The translation is problematic for several reasons:
1. "whakapā atu" is not a standard way to refer to passphrase; "kupuhipa" is more idiomatic in Māori for "passphrase" or "password".
2. "whakapau kōnae" does not sensibly translate to "wallet decryption". "whakamuna" is closer to "encryption/decryption" and "pūtea" is "wallet".
3. The sentence does not handle instructions about the null character and retrial with only the characters up to the first null character.
4. Several sections are omitted or mistranslated.

Correct translation:

The translation is problematic. The provided 'mi' (Māori) translation does not accurately translate "Loading banlist…". Instead, it vaguely refers to trying hard to translate the word "translation", which is unrelated to the source.

Correct translation:

The translation is inaccurate. "Whakaritea te rārangi whakaputa..." means "Set up the output list..." which does not correspond to "Loading block index…". The word "block" (pouaka or paraka, but "paraka" is used in technology), and "index" (aronga, or "rārangi tohu"/"whakaurutanga") are not represented, and "loading" is not reflected properly.

Correct translation:
Kei te uta i te rārangi paraka...
Alternatively:
Kei te uta i te rārangi tohu paraka...

The translation "Whakararuraru pūtea..." is problematic. "Whakararuraru" means "trouble" or "disturbance", not "loading". Therefore, it incorrectly translates "Loading wallet…".

Kei te uta ana te pūtea...

The translation "Whakarerekētia..." means "Change it..." or "Alter it..." in Māori, which is not the correct meaning for "Rescanning…". The source refers to the process of scanning again, such as the blockchain for transactions.

Correct translation:
Kei te āta tirotiro anō...
or
Kei te anō tātari...

Either would more accurately capture the repeated scanning process.

The translation is problematic. The English source says "Signing transaction failed," which means the attempt to sign a transaction did not succeed. The provided translation reads "Ko te whakakore i te whakauru i te whakaritenga" which more closely means "the cancellation of the input of the arrangement," which does not capture the original meaning.

Correct translation:

The translation is inaccurate. The source says the specified directory does not exist, but the Māori translation says "Cannot obtain the specified -walletdir," which doesn't convey the idea of non-existence. The format specifier "%s" is preserved correctly.

The translation is inaccurate.

The translation is inaccurate. The English sentence means "The specified config file %s does not exist," but the provided 'mi' translation says "The configuration file did not receive %s when it was being expended/consumed," which is incorrect and confusing.

        <translation>Ka whakakore te pōkeka i te utu iti ake i te utu tawhiti i te iti rawa.</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is problematic. The word "pōkeka" is not the standard or widely used transliteration or term for "wallet" in Te Reo Māori. Additionally, "utu tawhiti" does not properly communicate the idea of "relay fee" (a technical term in Bitcoin for the minimal transaction fee required for network propagation), and "ka whakakore" means "will cancel," which does not fully match the sense of "will avoid paying."

A more accurate translation would transpose the meaning as: "Ka karo te pūkete i te utu i raro iho i te utu whakawhiti iti rawa."

Correct translation:
Ka karo te pūkete i te utu i raro iho i te utu whakawhiti iti rawa.
```

The translation is inaccurate. In Māori ('mi'), the provided translation misuses "tāuta," which generally refers to "installation" or "setup," not a "transaction." The structure of the sentence is also awkward.

The translation is inaccurate. The phrase "Kāore e whakaaetia ngā moni whakaritenga kia whakararuraru" does not correctly convey "Transaction amounts must not be negative." A more accurate translation in Māori would be:

Kāore ngā moni whakawhitinga e āhei te noho hei tau tōraro.

Or more simply:

Kāore e taea ngā moni whakawhitinga te noho hei tōraro.

Correct translation:
Kāore ngā moni whakawhitinga e whakaaetia kia noho tōraro.

The translation is not an accurate or natural rendering of the English source. "Me whiwhi whakaritenga tātari tētahi whiwhi whakaritenga ki te kaiwhiwhi kotahi i te minimuma" is overly literal, awkward, and includes untranslated or unclear phrases (like "minimuma" for "minimum"). The phrase doesn't convey the actual meaning in clear Māori ('mi').

Correct translation:
Me whai te whakawhitinga ki te iti rawa kotahi te kaiwhiwhi.

The translation is inaccurate. The original sentence refers to "change address" in the context of Bitcoin (address to send the change back to), but the translation interprets "change" as "whakarerekē" (modification/change) and "transaction" ('whakaritenga') is repeated.

Correct translation:

The translation is problematic. The phrase "He whakawhitiwhitinga nui rawa te whakapau kaha" incorrectly translates "Transaction too large." The phrase includes "te whakapau kaha" which translates more to "exerting effort" or "putting in effort," which is not relevant here.

Correct translation:

This concisely means "The transaction is too large."

The translation is inaccurate. The English means "Unknown new rules activated (versionbit %i)", referring to new, unknown network rules that have been enabled.

The translation uses "wharepukapuka", which means "library" in Māori, instead of the correct term for "wallet", which would be "pūkete" or "pūtea". Also, "whakamātau" means "to test"—a better term would be "whakamana" (to verify), or simply "E whakamana ana i te/ngā pūkete...". The ellipsis should match the original: (…) not three periods (...), and Māori prefers single ellipsis, matching the source.

ERR
The translation is problematic. 

Issues:
- The phrase "Me whakakore i te whare moni" translates to "The wallet needs to be deleted," which is not the meaning in the English source. "Rewritten" means to recreate or rewrite, not delete.
- "Hei whakakore i te whakamutunga" means "to delete the end," which does not match "to complete."
- The translation does not correctly convey the instruction to restart %s to complete the rewriting process.
- The format specifier "%s" is present and correctly placed, but the surrounding sentence is inaccurate.

Correct translation:
Me tuhituhi anō te pūkete: tīmataria anō te %s hei whakaoti

This conveys that the wallet needs to be rewritten, and restarting %s is required to complete the process.
