```
        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>pindutin lamang ang kanang pindutan upang i-edit ang address o label.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it contains a grammatical error. The word "pindutin" is a verb that means "to press" or "to click". However, the phrase "pindutin lamang ang kanang pindutan" translates to "just press the right button" which is not the intended meaning. The correct translation should convey the meaning of "right-click" as a single action.

Correct translation: Mag-right-click upang i-edit ang address o label.
```

```
        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>Gayahin ang pinipiling ♦address♦ sa kasalakuyan sa ♦clipboard♦ ng sistem</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses Filipino words for "copy" and "system" that are not standard or natural-sounding. "Gayahin" means "imitate" or "resemble," which is not the correct meaning for "copy" in this context. "♦clipboard♦ ng sistem" is also a bit awkward; a more natural phrasing would be "clipboard ng system."

Correct translation: Kopyahin ang kasalukuyang napiling address sa clipboard ng system.
```

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>(Do you mean: Close?) :isara, sarado </translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it includes explanatory text "(Do you mean: Close?)" which is not present in the source text. This is extraneous information. The correct translation should only be the Filipino equivalent of "Close".

NO, (Do you mean: Close?) :isara, sarado
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Piliin ang ♦address♦ kung saan ipapadala ang mga barya</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses a non-standard character (♦) which is not present in the source text and is unnecessary. The direct translation of "address" is sufficient.

Correct translation: Piliin ang address kung saan ipapadala ang mga barya
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>(do you mean: CHOOSE?) ;Pumili,Piliin.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is problematic. The additional "(do you mean: CHOOSE?) ;Pumili,Piliin." is unnecessary and unprofessional for a translation.
The correct translation should only be the Tagalog equivalent of "Choose".

NO
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Ito ang mga ♦address♦ ng ♦Bitcoin♦ mo para pagpapadala ng mga bayad. Palaging suriin mo ang halaga at address kung saan tatanggap bago magpadala ka ng mga ♦coin.</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses "♦address♦" and "♦Bitcoin♦" and "♦coin♦" which are not part of the original sentence. It also has an unnecessary "mo" after "suriin" and "ka" after "magpadala".

NO. Ito ang mga address ng Bitcoin mo para pagpapadala ng mga bayad. Palaging suriin ang halaga at address kung saan tatanggap bago magpadala ng mga coin.
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang ♦Address♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it includes a symbol (♦) that is not present in the source text and may be confusing for the user. The translation is also not accurate.
Kopyahin ang Address
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>♦Address♦</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it includes extraneous characters ('♦') that are not present in the source text. This is likely an artifact of the translation process and is not standard in the Tagalog language.

The correct translation for "Address" in Tagalog, especially in the context of Bitcoin, would be:

Address
```

```
        <source>Passphrase Dialog</source>
        <translation>♦Passphrase♦ na ♦Dialog♦</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and uses placeholder characters instead of actual Filipino words. The terms "Passphrase" and "Dialog" are not directly translated.

Correct translation: ♦Passphrase♦ na ♦Dialog♦
```

```
        <source>Enter passphrase</source>
        <translation>Ilagay ang ♦passphrase♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses a diamond symbol (♦) which is not present in the source text and might be considered problematic or confusing in the context of Bitcoin.

NO
```

```
        <source>New passphrase</source>
        <translation>Bagong ♦passphrase♦</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses a special character (♦) that is not present in the source text and is likely not intended to be part of a passphrase. The correct translation should be:

Bagong passphrase
```

```
        <source>Repeat new passphrase</source>
        <translation>Ulitin ang bagong ♦passphrase♦</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses a diamond symbol (♦) instead of the correct quotation marks for the word "passphrase". This is an erroneous formatting issue.

Correct translation: Ulitin ang bagong "passphrase"
```

```
        <source>Change passphrase</source>
        <translation>Palitan ang ♦passphrase♦</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The symbol "♦" is an unnecessary and incorrect addition.

NO
```

```
        <source>Confirm wallet encryption</source>
        <translation>Kumpirmahin ang ♦encryption♦ ng pitaka</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses an unrelated symbol "♦" which is not present in the source text.
Correct translation: Kumpirmahin ang encryption ng pitaka
```

```
        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Babala: IKung i-encrypt mo ang iyong pitaka at mawawala ang ♦passphrase♦,  &lt;b&gt;MAWAWALA MO ANG LAHAT NG IYONG MGA BITCOIN&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>
    
YES, The translation has an extra character before the word "Kung".
Babala: Kung i-encrypt mo ang iyong pitaka at mawawala ang ♦passphrase♦, &lt;b&gt;MAWAWALA MO ANG LAHAT NG IYONG MGA BITCOIN&lt;/b&gt;!
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>
        <translation>Ilagay ang bagong ♦passphrase♦ para sa pitaka.&lt;br/&gt;Pakigamit ang ♦passphrase♦ of &lt;b&gt;sampu o higit pa na mga ♦random♦ na mga karakter&lt;/b&gt;, o &lt;b&gt;walo o higit pang mga salita&lt;/b&gt;.</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses diamond symbols (♦) around words that are not meant to be emphasized or special in the original text. The word "random" is also repeated.

NO. Ilagay ang bagong passphrase para sa pitaka.&lt;br/&gt;Pakigamit ang passphrase na sampu o higit pa na mga random na karakter, o walo o higit pang mga salita.
```

```
        <source>The supplied passphrases do not match.</source>
        <translation>Ang mga ibinigay na mga ♦passphrase♦ ay hindi nagtugma.</translation>
    
YES. The translation includes an unnecessary and potentially confusing symbol (♦) around the word "passphrase".

NO. Ang mga ibinigay na passphrase ay hindi nagtugma.
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>Ang ♦passphrase♦ na ipinasok sa ♦decryption♦ sa pitaka ay hindi tama.</translation>
    
YES. The translation contains several direct English words that are not translated into Tagalog, making it awkward and incorrect.

Ang passphrase na ipinasok para sa pag-decrypt ng wallet ay mali.
```

```
        <source>Warning: The Caps Lock key is on!</source>
        <translation>Babala: Ang ♦Caps Lock Key♦ ay naka-on!</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains unwanted decorative characters, specifically "♦" around "Caps Lock Key". This is not present in the source text and is not appropriate for this context.
Babala: naka-on ang Caps Lock key!
```

```
        <source>Do you want to reset settings to default values, or to abort without making changes?</source>
        <extracomment>Explanatory text shown on startup when the settings file cannot be read. Prompts user to make a choice between resetting or aborting.</extracomment>
        <translation>Gusto mo bang i-reset ang mga ♦setting♦ sa ♦default♦ na mga ♦value♦, o itigil na hindi gumagawa ng mga pagbabago?</translation>
    
YES: The translation contains extraneous symbols (♦) that are not present in the source text. The correct translation should not include these symbols.
Gusto mo bang i-reset ang mga setting sa default na mga value, o itigil na hindi gumagawa ng mga pagbabago?
```

```
        <source>A fatal error occurred. Check that settings file is writable, or try running with -nosettings.</source>
        <extracomment>Explanatory text shown on startup when the settings file could not be written. Prompts user to check that we have the ability to write to the file. Explains that the user has the option of running without a settings file.</extracomment>
        <translation>Isang malubhang pagkakamali ang naganap. Suriin ang mga ♦setting♦ ng ♦file♦ na ♦writable♦, o subukan na patakbuhin sa ♦-nosettings♦.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic because it retains English words that should have been translated, such as "settings", "file", "writable", and "-nosettings". The use of diamonds around these words is also unusual and not standard in Tagalog.

NO: Nagkaroon ng malubhang pagkakamali. Suriin kung ang configuration file ay maaaring sulatan, o subukang patakbuhin nang walang settings.
```

```
        <source>default wallet</source>
        <translation>pitaka na ♦default♦</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains unwanted content. The word "♦default♦" is not a proper translation and appears to be an artifact from another system or a placeholder.

NO
```

```
        <source>Modify configuration options for %1</source>
        <translation>Baguhin ang mga pagpipilian sa ♦configuration♦ para sa %1</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses a placeholder character "♦" that is not present in the source text. This should be removed.
Baguhin ang mga pagpipilian sa configuration para sa %1
```

```
        <source>Network activity disabled.</source>
        <extracomment>A substring of the tooltip.</extracomment>
        <translation>Na-disable ang aktibidad ng ♦network♦</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic because it uses an unnecessary diamond symbol (♦) around the word "network". This symbol does not appear in the source text and does not have a clear functional purpose in this context. The word "network" should be translated directly without any special formatting.

Correct translation: Na-disable ang aktibidad ng network.
```

```
        <source>Send coins to a Bitcoin address</source>
        <translation>Magpadala ng mga ♦coin♦ sa ♦address♦ ng Bitcoin</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains a formatting error. The diamond symbols ♦ are not present in the original text and have been added erroneously.
Magpadala ng mga coin sa Bitcoin address
```

```
        <source>Change the passphrase used for wallet encryption</source>
        <translation>Palitan ang ♦passphrase♦ na ginamit para sa pag-encrypt sa pitaka</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it uses an incorrect translation for "passphrase" and adds an irrelevant symbol.
The correct translation should be: Palitan ang passphrase na ginamit para sa pag-encrypt sa pitaka
```

```
        <source>Change Passphrase…</source>
        <translation>Palitan ang ♦Passphrase♦...</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses a diamond symbol (♦) around "Passphrase" which is not present in the source text and is visually distracting and unnecessary.

NO. Palitan ang Passphrase...
```

```
        <source>Sign messages with your Bitcoin addresses to prove you own them</source>
        <translation>Tanda na mga mensahe sa mga ♦address♦ ng iyong ♦Bitcoin♦ para patunayan na pagmamay-ari mo sila</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses the Tagalog word "♦address♦" which is a direct transliteration of the English word "address". The correct Tagalog word for "address" in the context of Bitcoin addresses is "▪ADDRESS▪" which is the accepted term within the Filipino Bitcoin community. Also, "♦Bitcoin♦" should be translated to "▪BITCOIN▪".

NO, Tandaan ang mga mensahe gamit ang iyong ▪ADDRESS▪ ng ▪BITCOIN▪ upang patunayan na pagmamay-ari mo sila
```

```
        <source>Load PSBT from file…</source>
        <translation>I-load ang PSBT mula sa ♦file♦...</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains a problematic character. The character '♦' is not a standard character and should not be present in the translation. It is also an unnecessary formatting character. The correct translation should simply be "I-load ang PSBT mula sa file…".

NO
```

```
        <source>Open URI…</source>
        <translation>Buksan ang ♦URL♦...</translation>
    
YES. The translation introduces a non-standard character "♦" which is not present in the source text and can cause rendering issues or be interpreted unexpectedly by the Bitcoin software. Additionally, the source text specifies "URI" which is a general term, while the translation uses "URL" which is a subset of URI.

NO. Buksan ang URI…
```

```
        <source>File</source>
        <translation>♦File♦</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because it introduces extraneous symbols ('♦') that are not present in the source text and do not convey any meaningful information in the context of Bitcoin. The word "File" in this context is likely a menu item or a label.

Correct translation:
File
```

```
        <source>Settings</source>
        <translation>Mga ♦Setting♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation includes a diamond symbol (♦) that is not present in the source text and should not be there.
Correct translation: Mga Setting
```

```
        <source>Syncing Headers (%1%)…</source>
        <translation>♦Syncing Headers♦ (%1%)…</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains extraneous symbols that were not present in the source text.

Correct translation: Syncing Headers (%1%)…
```

```
        <source>Synchronizing with network…</source>
        <translation>Sini-siynchronize sa ♦network♦...</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses a non-standard symbol "♦" which is not appropriate for the context of Bitcoin. The word "network" is also unnecessarily enclosed within this symbol. The correct translation should simply be "Sini-synchronize sa network…".
Sini-synchronize sa network…
```

```
        <source>Indexing blocks on disk…</source>
        <translation>Ini-index ang mga bloke sa ♦disk♦...</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "disk" was incorrectly translated to "♦disk♦".
The correct translation should be "Ini-index ang mga bloke sa disk...".
```

```
        <source>Processing blocks on disk…</source>
        <translation>Pinoproseso ang mga bloke sa ♦disk♦...</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains a special character "♦" which is not present in the source text and is likely an unwanted character. The correct translation should not include this character.

Correct translation: Pinoproseso ang mga bloke sa disk…
```

```
        <source>Connecting to peers…</source>
        <translation>Kumokonekta sa mga ♦peers♦...</translation>
    
YES, The diamond character ♦ is not a standard character to use in the Filipino language and it's also not a standard character in the Bitcoin context. The correct translation should be: Kumokonekta sa mga peers...
```

```
        <source>Request payments (generates QR codes and bitcoin: URIs)</source>
        <translation>Humiling ng mga bayad (gumagawa ng ♦QR codes♦ at ♦bitcoin: URIs♦)</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses unusual symbols (♦) around "QR codes" and "bitcoin: URIs" which are not present in the source text. The word "gumagawa" means "makes" or "creates", which is fine, but the overall phrasing with the symbols makes it sound unnatural and potentially misleading. A more direct and accurate translation is needed.

Humiling ng mga bayad (lumilikha ng mga QR code at bitcoin: URI)
```

```
        <source>Command-line options</source>
        <translation>♦Command-line♦ na mga pagpipilian</translation>
    
YES: The translation contains a non-standard character "♦" which is not present in the source text.
Command-line options
```

```
        <source>Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction</source>
        <translation>Ang ♦Load♦ ay Bahagyang Napirmahan na Transaksyon sa ♦Bitcoin♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "Load" is translated literally as "Ang ♦Load♦", which is incorrect. "Load" in this context likely refers to the action of loading a transaction. Also, the placement of the ♦ symbols is unusual and disrupts the flow of the sentence.

A more appropriate translation would be:

YES, Ang pag-load ng bahagyang napirmahan na Bitcoin transaction.
```

```
        <source>Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Ang ♦Load♦ ay Bahagyang Napirmahan na Transaksyon sa ♦Bitcoin♦ mula sa ♦clipboard♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation has stray characters and unnecessary formatting.
The translation should be: "I-load ang Bahagyang Napirmahan na Bitcoin Transaction mula sa clipboard".
The original translation is: "Ang ♦Load♦ ay Bahagyang Napirmahan na Transaksyon sa ♦Bitcoin♦ mula sa ♦clipboard♦".
The translation has extra characters like ♦ and "Ang" and "ay" which are not needed. The word "clipboard" was also translated, but it is an English term that is commonly used in computing and does not require translation.
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses</source>
        <translation>Pagpapadalhan na mga ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the word "address" was translated literally to "♦address♦". In the context of Bitcoin, the term "address" refers to a Bitcoin wallet address. A more appropriate translation would be "mga address ng wallet" or "mga wallet address". The use of the diamond symbol (♦) is also unusual and likely an error.
The correct translation should be: "Mga address na pinagpadalhan"
```

```
        <source>Receiving addresses</source>
        <translation>Pagtatanggapan na mga ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains a problematic character (♦). The translation should be "Pagtatanggapan na mga address".
Pagtatanggapan na mga address
```

```
        <source>Open a bitcoin: URI</source>
        <translation>Buksan ang ♦bitcoin: URI♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it incorrectly uses a diamond symbol (♦) and a bolded "bitcoin" in the translation, which are not present in the source text. The source text is a simple instruction for opening a Bitcoin URI.

The correct translation should be:
Buksan ang bitcoin: URI
```

```
        <source>Show the %1 help message to get a list with possible Bitcoin command-line options</source>
        <translation>Ipakita ang %1 tumulong sa mensahe na kumuha ng listahan ng posibleng ♦Bitcoin command-line♦ na mga pagpipilian</translation>
    
YES, the translation is inaccurate and contains erroneous content. The phrase "tumulong sa mensahe na kumuha ng listahan" is not a natural or correct translation of "help message to get a list". The term "♦Bitcoin command-line♦ na mga pagpipilian" is also awkward and uses unnecessary symbols.

NO
```

```
        <source>Main Window</source>
        <translation>Pangunahing ♦Window♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains unusual characters (♦) that are not present in the source text and make the translation unprofessional. The correct translation is "Main Window".
```

```
        <source>Enable network activity</source>
        <extracomment>A context menu item. The network activity was disabled previously.</extracomment>
        <translation>I-enable ang aktibidad ng ♦network♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains an unnecessary diamond symbol around the word "network". The correct translation should be "I-enable ang aktibidad ng network".
NO, I-enable ang aktibidad ng network
```

```
        <source>Address: %1
</source>
        <translation>♦Address♦: %1
</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains extraneous characters that are not present in the source text.
Correct translation: Address: %1
```

```
        <source>HD key generation is &lt;b&gt;disabled&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>♦HD key generation♦ ay &lt;b&gt;na-disable&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the Tagalog word "ay" is used incorrectly in this sentence. It should not be present.
♦HD key generation♦ is &lt;b&gt;disabled&lt;/b&gt;
```

```
        <source>Coin Selection</source>
        <translation>Pagpipilian ng ♦coin♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it incorrectly translates "Coin Selection" to "Pagpipilian ng ♦coin♦". The translation should be "Pagpili ng barya".

NO
```

```
        <source>List mode</source>
        <translation>Listajhan na ♦mode♦</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses non-standard characters and adds an extraneous symbol, making it problematic.
Correct translation: Listahan mode
```

```
        <source>Received with label</source>
        <translation>Natanggap na may kasamang ♦tatak♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the word "tatak" (label) is not the best translation in the context of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the term "label" is used to categorize or tag addresses. A more appropriate translation would be "etiketa" or "bandila."

Natanggap na may kasamang ♦etiketa♦
```

```
        <source>Received with address</source>
        <translation>Natanggap na may ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses an incorrect term for "Received". The correct translation should be "Natanggap". Additionally, the diamond symbol "♦" is not appropriate in this context.
Natanggap gamit ang address
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses a diamond symbol ♦ around the word 'address' which is not present in the source text. This could be considered unwanted formatting or an error. The correct translation should be "Kopyahin ang address".
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang address</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy bytes</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang ♦bytes♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation includes an emoji that is not present in the source text.
Kopyahin ang bytes
```

```
        <source>Can vary +/- %1 satoshi(s) per input.</source>
        <translation>Maaaring magbago ng +/- %1♦4satoshi(s)♦ kada ♦input♦.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because of the inclusion of incorrect characters and formatting within the translation. The characters '♦4satoshi(s)♦' and '♦input♦' are not standard Tagalog and appear to be artifacts of an incorrect formatting process or a misunderstanding of the source text. The format specifier '%1' should also be directly transferred without any additional characters around it.

NO, Maaaring magbago ng +/- %1 satoshi kada input.
```

```
        <source>Closing the wallet for too long can result in having to resync the entire chain if pruning is enabled.</source>
        <translation>Ang pagsasarod sa pitaka sa matagal ay maaaring humantong sa pag-resync ng kabuuang ♦chain♦ kung ang pagputol ay na-enable.</translation>
    
YES, The translation incorrectly translated the word "chain" as "♦chain♦". The correct translation should be "kadena" or "blockchain".
Ang pagsasarado sa pitaka sa matagal ay maaaring humantong sa pag-resync ng kabuuang kadena kung ang pagputol ay pinagana.
```

```
        <source>Encrypt the wallet. The wallet will be encrypted with a passphrase of your choice.</source>
        <translation>I-encrypt ang pitaka. Ang pitaka ay mae-encrypt na may ♦passphrase♦ ng iyong mapipili.</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses a diamond symbol ♦ to enclose the word "passphrase". This is not a standard way to highlight text and can be confusing or look like an error. The word "passphrase" should be translated or retained without special symbols.

Correct translation: I-encrypt ang pitaka. Ang pitaka ay mae-encrypt gamit ang isang passphrase na iyong pipiliin.
```

```
        <source>Disable private keys for this wallet. Wallets with private keys disabled will have no private keys and cannot have an HD seed or imported private keys. This is ideal for watch-only wallets.</source>
        <translation>I-disable ang mga pribadong mga susi para sa pitaka na ito. Ang mga pitaka na may mga pribadong mga susi na na-disable ay mawawalng ng pribadong mga susi at hindi magkakaroon ng ♦HD seed♦ o mga na-import na pribadong mga susi. Ito ay perpekto lamang para sa mga ♦watch-only♦ na mga pitaka.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because of the use of the ♦ symbol, which is not part of the original English text and may be considered formatting spam. Additionally, the repeated use of "mga" (the Tagalog plural marker) makes the translation sound unnatural.

Here's a corrected translation:

I-disable ang mga pribadong susi para sa wallet na ito. Ang mga wallet na may naka-disable na pribadong susi ay walang mga pribadong susi at hindi magkakaroon ng HD seed o mga imported na pribadong susi. Ito ay mainam para sa mga watch-only wallet.
```

```
        <source>Use an external signing device such as a hardware wallet. Configure the external signer script in wallet preferences first.</source>
        <translation>Gumamit ng panlabas na pagpirmang ♦device♦ katulad ng ♦hardware♦ na pitaka. I-configure ang panlabas na ♦signer script♦ sa loob ng ♦preferences♦ ng pitaka n listahan. </translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic due to several issues. The use of "♦device♦", "♦hardware♦", "♦signer script♦", and "♦preferences♦" is unnatural and likely an artifact of a bad translation process or tool. The word "listahan" (list) at the end seems out of place and doesn't fit the context of wallet preferences. The phrasing "sa loob ng ♦preferences♦ ng pitaka n listahan" is also grammatically awkward.

Correct translation: Gumamit ng panlabas na signing device tulad ng hardware wallet. I-configure muna ang external signer script sa mga kagustuhan ng wallet.
```

```
        <source>External signer</source>
        <translation>Panlabas na ♦signer♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic due to the inclusion of a non-standard character (♦) which is not part of the original English text and appears to be an error. Additionally, the word "signer" is not translated, which suggests an incomplete or inaccurate translation. The context is Bitcoin, where "signer" would refer to a party that signs a Bitcoin transaction.

NO

        <translation>Pinagsama-sama na walang suporta ng ♦pag-pirma♦ (kailangan para sa panlabasna pagpirma)</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains problematic content. The symbol "♦" is not a standard character for representing Bitcoin concepts and appears to be an extraneous formatting artifact. Additionally, there is a spacing error with "panlabasna".

NO, Pinagsama-sama na walang suporta ng panlabas na pagpirma (kailangan para sa panlabas na pagpirma)

        <source>Edit Address</source>
        <translation>I-edit ang ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses a diamond symbol (♦) which is not present in the source text and is inappropriate for a Bitcoin context. It should be removed.
I-edit ang address
```

```
        <source>The label associated with this address list entry</source>
        <translation>Ang tatak na nauugnay sa ♦entry♦ ng listahan ng ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses a placeholder "♦entry♦" that is not present in the source text.
Ang tatak na nauugnay sa entry na ito sa listahan ng address
```

```
        <source>The address associated with this address list entry. This can only be modified for sending addresses.</source>
        <translation>Ang ♦address♦ na may kaugnayan sa ipinasok sa listahan ng ♦address♦. Ito ay maaari lamang ng mabago para sa pagpapadalhan na mga ♦address♦.</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains an unnecessary symbol (♦) which is not present in the source text and also has grammatical errors.
Ang address na nauugnay sa entry na ito sa listahan ng address. Mababago lamang ito para sa mga address na pagpapadalhan.
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>♦Address♦</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it includes extraneous characters ('♦') that are not present in the source text. This is likely an artifact of the translation process and is not standard in the Tagalog language.

The correct translation for "Address" in Tagalog, especially in the context of Bitcoin, would be:

Address
```

```
        <source>New sending address</source>
        <translation>Bagong pagpapadalhan na ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains a problematic character '♦' which is not present in the source text and disrupts the intended meaning. The format specifier for 'address' is also incorrectly enclosed within these characters.

Correct translation: Bagong pagpapadalhan na %address%
```

```
        <source>The entered address "%1" is not a valid Bitcoin address.</source>
        <translation>Ang naipasok na ♦address♦ "%1" ay hindi wasto na ♦Bitcoin address♦.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic because it uses non-standard characters (♦) and does not translate the term "Bitcoin" correctly.

The correct translation should be: "Ang naipasok na address "%1" ay hindi wasto na Bitcoin address."
```

```
        <source>The entered address "%1" is already in the address book with label "%2".</source>
        <translation>Ang naipasok na ♦address♦ "%1" ay nasa aklat na ng ♦address♦ na may tatak "%2".</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it incorrectly translates the word "address" into " ♦address♦ ". While the context is Bitcoin, the word "address" should be translated to Filipino as "address" and not something else.

The correct translation is: Ang naipasok na address "%1" ay nasa aklat na ng address na may tatak "%2".
```

```
        <source>New key generation failed.</source>
        <translation>Ang Bagong susi sa ♦generation♦ ay nabigo.</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses unnecessary formatting characters which are not present in the source text. The word "generation" is enclosed in ♦♦ which is likely a result of a formatting error or misinterpretation.

NO, Ang bagong susi sa pagbuo ay nabigo.
```

```
        <source>A new data directory will be created.</source>
        <translation>May bagong datos na ♦directory♦ ay magagawa.</translation>
    
YES: The word "♦directory♦" is not a valid Filipino word and appears to be a placeholder or a misinterpretation. The phrase "may bagong datos na... ay magagawa" is also grammatically awkward.

Correct translation: Magbubukas ang isang bagong data directory.
```

```
        <source>Directory already exists. Add %1 if you intend to create a new directory here.</source>
        <translation>Ang ♦directory♦ ay mayroon na. Magdagdag ng%1kung balak mong gumawa ng bagong ♦directory♦ dito.</translation>
    
YES, The translation has some issues. The format specifier "%1" is not correctly transferred, as it should be followed by a space. Also, the translation of "directory" using "♦directory♦" is not ideal as it introduces unnecessary special characters.

NO, Ang ♦directory♦ ay mayroon na. Magdagdag ng %1 kung balak mong gumawa ng bagong ♦directory♦ dito.
```

```
        <source>Cannot create data directory here.</source>
        <translation>Hindi makakagawa ng datos na ♦directory♦ dito.</translation>
    
YES, The word "♦directory♦" is not a Tagalog word. It should be "direktoryo" to mean "directory."
Hindi makakagawa ng datos na direktoryo dito.
```

```
        <source>At least %1 GB of data will be stored in this directory, and it will grow over time.</source>
        <translation>Hindi bababa sa %1 ng ♦GB♦ na dato ay mailalagay sa ♦directory♦, at lalaki sa paglipas ng panahon.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it incorrectly translates the format specifier %1 and the word "directory".
Correct translation: Hindi bababa sa %1 GB na data ang ilalagay sa direktoryong ito, at lalaki ito sa paglipas ng panahon.
```

```
        <source>Size of database cache</source>
        <translation>Laki ng ♦database cache♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because of the use of a special character '♦' which is not part of the Tagalog language. The translation also uses "Laki ng" which means "Size of" but it does not fit the context of Bitcoin. A better translation would be "Sukat ng database cache" which means "Size of database cache".

NO
Sukat ng database cache
```

```
        <source>Number of script verification threads</source>
        <translation>Bilang ng ♦script♦ pagpapatunay na mga ♦threads♦</translation>
    
YES
The translation includes unnecessary and potentially confusing special characters (♦) around the words "script" and "threads". These characters do not appear in the source text and do not enhance the meaning.

Correct translation: Bilang ng script verification threads
```

```
        <source>Network</source>
        <translation>♦Network♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it incorrectly translates "Network" to "♦Network♦". The use of symbols like '♦' is not standard for translating the word "Network" in Tagalog, especially in the context of Bitcoin.

Correct translation: Network
```

```
        <source>Prune block storage to</source>
        <translation>Putulan i-block ang imbakan sa</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and problematic. The word "Prune" in the context of Bitcoin refers to removing unnecessary data from the blockchain to save space, not physically cutting or pruning something. The Tagalog translation provided is a literal and incorrect interpretation.

NO
```

```
        <source>External signer script path</source>
        <translation>Panlabas na ♦signer script♦ na daanan</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains a problematic character. The diamond symbol ♦ is not a standard character and is likely a placeholder for a different character or symbol.

External signer script path
Panlabas na signer script na daanan
```

```

        <translation>Pinagsama-sama na walang suporta ng ♦pag-pirma♦ (kailangan para sa panlabasna pagpirma)</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains problematic content. The symbol "♦" is not a standard character for representing Bitcoin concepts and appears to be an extraneous formatting artifact. Additionally, there is a spacing error with "panlabasna".

        <extracomment>Context menu action to copy the address of a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES, The word "address" should be translated to Filipino word for address, which is "address". The symbol "♦" is also not needed. The correct translation should be "Kopyahin ang address".
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses a diamond symbol ♦ around the word 'address' which is not present in the source text. This could be considered unwanted formatting or an error. The correct translation should be "Kopyahin ang address".
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang address</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy bytes</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang ♦bytes♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation includes an emoji that is not present in the source text.
Kopyahin ang bytes
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang ♦address♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses a diamond symbol ♦ around the word 'address' which is not present in the source text. This could be considered unwanted formatting or an error. The correct translation should be "Kopyahin ang address".

```
        <source>Copy transaction ID</source>
        <translation>Kopyahin ang transaksyon  ng ♦ID♦</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the format specifier "♦ID♦" is not taken over correctly.
Kopyahin ang transaction ID
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>♦Address♦</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it includes extraneous characters ('♦') that are not present in the source text. This is likely an artifact of the translation process and is not standard in the Tagalog language.

The correct translation for "Address" in Tagalog, especially in the context of Bitcoin, would be:

Address
