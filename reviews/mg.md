```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>Fafao ao anaty lisitra ny adiresy voamarika</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text asks to delete the selected address, but the translation says "Fafao ao anaty lisitra ny adiresy voamarika" which translates to "Delete the marked address from the list". This is a subtle but important difference. The translation should use a word that means "selected" instead of "marked".

Correct translation: Fafao amin'ny lisitra ny adiresy voafantina
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Kitapom-bola:</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning of "Wallet" in the context of Bitcoin. The provided Malagasy word "Kitapom-bola" means "coin purse" or "money bag", which is not the correct term for a Bitcoin wallet.

Correct translation: <translation>Tombokavata-bola:</translation>
```

```
        <source>Sign message…</source>
        <translation>Soniavo hafatra...</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The Malagasy word "Soniavo" is not a recognized word and appears to be a misspelling or incorrect translation of "Sign". The correct translation for "Sign message…" in Malagasy is "Siña hafatra...".

NO
