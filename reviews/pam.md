```
        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>I-right click ban alilan ing address o label</translation>
    
YES. The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning. The word "ban" means "to ban" or "prohibit," which is the opposite of what "edit" means.

Correct translation: "I-right click ban alilan ing address o label" should be "I-right click para alilan ing address o label".
```

```
        <source>New</source>
        <translation>Bayu</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The Pam word 'Bayu' does not accurately translate the English word 'New' in the context of Bitcoin. It seems to be a personal name or a completely unrelated word.

The correct translation for "New" in this context would depend on the specific nuance intended. However, without more context, a general translation for "New" in Pam that could fit a Bitcoin context (e.g., new transaction, new address) is not readily available and 'Bayu' is not a suitable option. If the intent is to convey something being newly created or introduced, a word like "Baru" (which is often used in Malay and Indonesian for "new" and might have cognates or similar words in Pam depending on its linguistic family) would be more appropriate, but confirmation of this is needed. Given the lack of direct translation and the potential for misinterpretation, it's best to avoid 'Bayu'.

Correct translation: **UNK_LANG** (as a suitable translation for "New" in a Bitcoin context in Pam is not identifiable without further linguistic knowledge of Pam).
```

```
        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>Kopyan me ing makalage address king system clipboard</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing in the target language (Pam). The word "me" is used incorrectly, and the sentence structure is not natural.

The correct translation should be: "Kopyan ing menaus a address king system clipboard"
```

```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>Ilako me ing kasalungsungang makalage address king listaan</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The source text "Delete the currently selected address from the list" has been translated to "Ilako me ing kasalungsungang makalage address king listaan". The verb "makalage" (which seems to be used for "selected") is not a standard or commonly used word in Kapampangan. The more appropriate translation for "selected" in this context would be "pilî" or "pikuan".

Correct translation: "Ilako me ing kasalungsungang pilîng address king listaan"
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Export me ing data king tab a ini anting metung a file</translation>
    
YES. The translation is nonsensical and contains no recognizable words from any known language. The format specifiers are also missing from the translation.
Correct translation: "Export the data in the current tab to a file"
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>IExport</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and should be "Eksport".
YES, Eksport
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Mamili kang address a mamarlang coins</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and doesn't convey the intended meaning. "Mamarlang" does not mean "send to" in a way that makes sense in this context.

Correct translation: "Piliin ang address na padadalhan ng coins"
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Oreni ring Bitcoin address mu king pamamarla karing bayad. Lawan mong masalese ring ulaga ra ampon ing address na ning mananggapan bayad bayu ka mamarla.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The translation uses a verb "king pamamarla" (for sending) which is not grammatically correct in the context of the sentence. It should be "para king pamamarla" (for sending).

The correct translation is:
Oreni ring Bitcoin address mu para king pamamarla karing bayad. Lawan mong masalese ring ulaga ra ampon ing address na ning mananggapan bayad bayu ka mamarla.
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES: The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text "(no label)" implies the absence of a label, while the translation "(alang label)" suggests the presence of a label named "alang", which is incorrect and potentially misleading in a Bitcoin context.
(walay label)
```

```
        <source>Enter passphrase</source>
        <translation>Mamalub kang passphrase</translation>
    
YES
The word "mamalub" is likely a mistranslation or an invented word, as it doesn't appear to be a standard word in any commonly recognized language. The intended meaning is to "enter" or "input" a passphrase.

Correct translation: **Mamalub kang passphrase** is an incorrect translation. A more appropriate translation would be **Maglagay ng passphrase**.
```

```
        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Kapabaluan: Istung in-encrypt me ing kekang wallet at meala ya ing passphrase na, ma-&lt;b&gt;ALA NO NGAN RING KEKANG BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses "Kapabaluan" which means "Knowledge" instead of "Warning". The correct translation for "Warning" would be "Babala".

Correct translation: Babala: Istung in-encrypt me ing kekang wallet at meala ya ing passphrase na, ma-&lt;b&gt;ALA NO NGAN RING KEKANG BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing pamag-encrypt king wallet </translation>
    
YES
The word "Memali" is not a recognized word in the Tagalog language for "Wallet". The correct Tagalog word for wallet is "Wallet" or "Bolsa".
Memali ya ing pamag-encrypt king wallet
Correct translation: Wallet ya ing pamag-encrypt king wallet or Bolsa ya ing pamag-encrypt king wallet
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing encryption uli na ning ausan dang internal error. E ya me-encrypt ing wallet yu.</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses "Memali ya ing encryption uli" which roughly translates to "Wallet encryption has failed". However, the correct wording for "Wallet encryption failed" in the context of Bitcoin would be "E ya encrypti ing wallet", which means "The wallet has been encrypted". The original sentence states that the wallet was *not* encrypted, so the translation should reflect that. Additionally, "ausan dang internal error" is a literal translation of "due to an internal error", which can be improved for fluency.

Correct translation: "E ya encrypti ing wallet uli ka reng internal error. E ya me-encrypt ing wallet yu."
```

```
        <source>The supplied passphrases do not match.</source>
        <translation>E la mitutugma ring mibieng passphrase</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it is not an accurate representation of the source text. The source text is in English, and the translation is in a language that does not appear to be 'pam' based on the provided output. Therefore, the language is unknown. UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Wallet unlock failed</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing pamag-unlock king wallet </translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it uses an incorrect word for "failed". The correct word for "failed" in this context would be "mali".

Correct translation: Memali ya ing pamag-unlock king wallet
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>E ya istu ing passphrase a pepalub da para king wallet decryption</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. It contains erroneous content and is not an accurate translation of the source English text. The provided 'pam' text is a garbled attempt at translation that doesn't convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence.

Correct translation: Ing passphrase a miparas para king wallet decryption ay ali tutuk.
```

```
        <source>Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.</source>
        <translation>Mi-alilan ne ing passphrase na ning wallet.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning. The phrase "Mi-alilan ne ing passphrase na ning wallet" translates to "The passphrase of the wallet was changed," but it's missing the word "successfully." The correct translation should indicate that the change was successful.

NO - Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.
```

```
        <source>Warning: The Caps Lock key is on!</source>
        <translation>Kapabaluan: Makabuklat ya ing Caps Lock key!</translation>
    
YES: The translation contains erroneous content. The word "Kapabaluan" is not a valid word in Tagalog, and the phrase "Makabuklat ya ing Caps Lock key!" is also grammatically incorrect and nonsensical.

The correct translation should be: "Babala: Naka-on ang Caps Lock key!"
```

```
        <source>Quit application</source>
        <translation>Tuknangan ing aplikasyon</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate. The word "Tuknangan" in the target language means "support" or "help", not "quit". The correct translation for "Quit application" should be something like "Lumabas sa aplikasyon" or "Isara ang aplikasyon".
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Tabs toolbar</source>
        <translation>Gamit para king Tabs</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "Gamit para king Tabs" translates to "Use for Tabs" or "Tool for Tabs", which is not a correct translation of "Tabs toolbar". The context is Bitcoin, and "toolbar" refers to a bar of tools or commands.

NO
```

```
        <source>Command-line options</source>
        <translation>Pipamilian command-line</translation>
    
YES
The translation is not accurate. "Pipamilian" is not a standard or understandable term in this context.

Correct translation:
Command-line options
```

```
        <source>Last received block was generated %1 ago.</source>
        <translation>Ing tatauling block a metanggap,  me-generate ya %1 ing milabas</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and contains erroneous content. The sentence structure and word choice do not correctly convey the meaning of the original English sentence.
Correct translation: Ing tauli tanggap a block, migawa ya %1 pa.</translation>
```

```
        <source>Information</source>
        <translation>Impormasion</translation>
    
YES, The translation has a spelling mistake. The correct translation should be "Informasion".
YES, Impormasion
```

```
        <source>Up to date</source>
        <translation>Makatuki ya king aldo</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Kopyan ing alaga</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect. "Ing alaga" means "the care" or "the health" in Kapampangan, which is not related to "amount". The correct translation for "amount" in Kapampangan is "penaun" or "lakad". The correct translation for "copy" in this context would be "kopyan".

Correct translation: Kopyan ing penaun
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES: The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text "(no label)" implies the absence of a label, while the translation "(alang label)" suggests the presence of a label named "alang", which is incorrect and potentially misleading in a Bitcoin context.
(walay label)
```

```
        <source>Edit receiving address</source>
        <translation>Alilan ya ing address king pamagpadala</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains erroneous content. The verb "alilan" means "to buy" or "to sell" and is not appropriate in this context. The phrase "king pamagpadala" means "for sending" and is also not appropriate.

The correct translation should be:

<translation>Bandal ya ing address</translation>
```

```
        <source>Edit sending address</source>
        <translation>Alilan ya ing address king pamagpadala</translation>
    
YES: The translation is not accurate and contains a grammatical error. The word "king" is unnecessary and makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.

Correct translation: Alilan ya ing address para king pamagpadala
```

```
        <source>The entered address "%1" is not a valid Bitcoin address.</source>
        <translation>Ing pepalub yung address "%1" ali ya katanggap-tanggap a Bitcoin address.</translation>
    
YES - The translation contains a grammatical error. The correct translation should use "a" instead of "ya" before "katanggap-tanggap".
Ing pepalub yung address "%1" ali ya katanggap-tanggap a Bitcoin address.
```

```
        <source>New key generation failed.</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing pamangaua king key</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and doesn't convey the meaning of the source text. The word "ing" is a definite article in Kapampangan and "pamangaua" means "creation" or "generation". The preposition "king" is used instead of "ing" to refer to the key.

The correct translation should be:
"Generated key failed."
Corrected translation: Ing key a banua me, dela."
```

```
        <source>version</source>
        <translation>bersion</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The correct translation for "version" is "bersiyon" in the context of Bitcoin terminology.
bersiyon
```

```
        <source>Command-line options</source>
        <translation>Pipamilian command-line</translation>
    
YES
The translation is not accurate. "Pipamilian" is not a standard or understandable term in this context.

Correct translation:
Command-line options
```

```
        <source>Show only a tray icon after minimizing the window.</source>
        <translation>Ipakit mu ing tray icon kaibat meng pelatian ing awang.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning of the source text. The phrase "pelatian ing awang" literally translates to "leave the space," which is not the correct way to express minimizing a window in this context.

The correct translation should be:

"Ipakit mu kabud ing icon keng tray kapag paliiti mu ya ing bintana."
```

```
        <source>Minimize on close</source>
        <translation>Palatian istung isara</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning of "Minimize on close" in the context of Bitcoin. The translation seems to be a literal, word-for-word interpretation that doesn't make sense.

Correct translation: Palahī ma pīni
```

```
        <source>Unit to show amounts in:</source>
        <translation>Ing Unit a ipakit king alaga ning:</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The word "Ing" is a definite article in Kapampangan, but its placement and the subsequent phrasing "Unit a ipakit king alaga ning" do not form a coherent or meaningful phrase for "Unit to show amounts in."

Correct translation:
<translation>Unit a lalabas king beluan:</translation>
```

```
        <source>The supplied proxy address is invalid.</source>
        <translation>Ing milageng proxy address eya katanggap-tanggap.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "milageng" which means "miraculous" and is not appropriate in this context. The correct translation should convey that the address is invalid.

Correct translation: Ing proxy address a mesadia ya basi ya basi.
```

```
        <source>The displayed information may be out of date. Your wallet automatically synchronizes with the Bitcoin network after a connection is established, but this process has not completed yet.</source>
        <translation>Ing makaltong impormasion mapalyaring luma ne. Ing kekang wallet otomatiku yang mag-synchronize keng Bitcoin network istung mekakonekta ne king network, oneng ing prosesung ini ali ya pa kumpletu.</translation>
    
YES - The translation incorrectly uses the word "makaltong" which means "bad" or "wrong" when the source intended "displayed". The correct translation for "displayed" in this context would be "pamakuan" or "impormasion a makalabas".

NO
```

```
        <source>Your current spendable balance</source>
        <translation>Ing kekang kasalungsungan balanse a malyari mung gastusan</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Your current total balance</source>
        <translation>Ing kekang kasalungsungan kabuuang balanse</translation>
    
YES, the translation is erroneous. The phrase "Ing kekang kasalungsungan kabuuang balanse" does not accurately translate "Your current total balance" in the context of Bitcoin. The words used appear to be from a different language, not related to Bitcoin terminology or standard Tagalog.

A more appropriate translation in Tagalog for "Your current total balance" in a Bitcoin context would be:

"Ang iyong kasalukuyang kabuuang balanse"
```

```
        <source>Client version</source>
        <translation>Bersion ning Cliente</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "Bersion" which appears to be a misspelling of "Version". The correct translation should be "Versión del cliente".
YES - Bersion ning Cliente
```

```
        <source>Information</source>
        <translation>Impormasion</translation>
    
YES, The translation has a spelling mistake. The correct translation should be "Informasion".
YES, Impormasion
```

```
        <source>To</source>
        <translation>Para kang</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning of "To".
Correct translation: Para sa
```

```
        <source>Message</source>
        <translation>Mensayi</translation>
    
YES. The translation is incorrect. The correct translation for "Message" in Pam is "Mensaje".
YES. The translation is incorrect. The correct translation for "Message" in Pam is "Mensaje".
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES: The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text "(no label)" implies the absence of a label, while the translation "(alang label)" suggests the presence of a label named "alang", which is incorrect and potentially misleading in a Bitcoin context.
(walay label)
```

```
        <source>Add Recipient</source>
        <translation>Maglage Tumanggap</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic because it does not accurately convey the intended meaning of "Add Recipient" in the context of Bitcoin. "Maglage Tumanggap" literally translates to "Always Receive," which is not the correct phrase for adding a recipient in a transaction. A more accurate translation would be "Magdagdag ng Tatanggap" or "Magdagdag ng Padadalhan."

Correct translation: Magdagdag ng Tatanggap
```

```
        <source>Clear All</source>
        <translation>I-Clear Eganagana</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses an invented word "Eganagana" which is not a standard or recognizable word in any language. The correct translation for "Clear All" in a Bitcoin context is likely "Clear All" itself, or if a translation is required, a more appropriate term depending on the specific language used for other parts of the UI. Without knowing the specific target language indicated by 'pam', it is impossible to provide a definitive correct translation.

However, if 'pam' refers to a placeholder for "unknown language," then the output should be:
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Kopyan ing alaga</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect. "Ing alaga" means "the care" or "the health" in Kapampangan, which is not related to "amount". The correct translation for "amount" in Kapampangan is "penaun" or "lakad". The correct translation for "copy" in this context would be "kopyan".

Correct translation: Kopyan ing penaun
```

```
        <source>The amount to pay must be larger than 0.</source>
        <translation>Ing alaga na ning bayaran dapat mung mas matas ya king 0.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses informal language ("dapat mung") which might not be appropriate for a technical context like Bitcoin. The phrase "mas matas ya king 0" is a bit awkward and could be more direct.

A more appropriate translation would be: "Ing alaga na ning bayaran dapat mas matas ya king 0." or "Ang halaga ng bayarin ay dapat mas malaki sa 0."
```

```
        <source>The total exceeds your balance when the %1 transaction fee is included.</source>
        <translation>Ing kabuuan mipasobra ya king kekang balanse istung inabe ya ing %1 a bayad king transaksion </translation>
    
YES - The translation has an extra space before the "%1" format specifier, and a space at the end. The correct translation should be: "Ing kabuuan mipasobra ya king kekang balanse istung inabe ya ing %1 a bayad king transaksion."
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES: The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text "(no label)" implies the absence of a label, while the translation "(alang label)" suggests the presence of a label named "alang", which is incorrect and potentially misleading in a Bitcoin context.
(walay label)
```

```
        <source>Signatures - Sign / Verify a Message</source>
        <translation>Pirma - Pirman / I-beripika ing mensayi</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses incorrect words for "Sign" and "Verify". The correct translation for "Sign" in this context is "Simak", and for "Verify" it is "Kiti".
Pirma - Simak / Kiti ing mensayi
```

```
        <source>Reset all sign message fields</source>
        <translation>Ibalik keng dati reng ngan fields keng pamamirmang mensayi</translation>
    
YES, the translation uses a slightly unnatural phrasing in Kapampangan. The word order and conjunction usage could be improved for better flow.

The correct translation should be: "Ibalik keng dati reng campi ning pamamirmang mensayi."
```

```
        <source>Clear All</source>
        <translation>I-Clear Eganagana</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses an invented word "Eganagana" which is not a standard or recognizable word in any language. The correct translation for "Clear All" in a Bitcoin context is likely "Clear All" itself, or if a translation is required, a more appropriate term depending on the specific language used for other parts of the UI. Without knowing the specific target language indicated by 'pam', it is impossible to provide a definitive correct translation.

However, if 'pam' refers to a placeholder for "unknown language," then the output should be:
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Verify Message</source>
        <translation>Beripikan ing Mensayi</translation>
    
YES, the translation is erroneous. The word "Beripikan" is not a standard word in any recognized language and appears to be a misspelling or corruption of "Verify". The word "Mensayi" is also not a standard word and is likely a misspelling or corruption of "Message".

The correct translation should be:
Verify Message
```

```
        <source>Verify the message to ensure it was signed with the specified Bitcoin address</source>
        <translation>Beripikan ing mensayi ban asiguradu a me pirma ya ini gamit ing mepiling Bitcoin address</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic due to inaccuracies and potential misunderstanding of the source text. The Pam translation does not accurately convey the meaning of "verify the message" and "signed with the specified Bitcoin address".

The correct translation should be:

"Tan-awa ing mensayi para sigurado keng mepirma ya gamit ing Bitcoin address a mepili"
```

```
        <source>Verify Message</source>
        <translation>Beripikan ing Mensayi</translation>
    
YES, the translation is erroneous. The word "Beripikan" is not a standard word in any recognized language and appears to be a misspelling or corruption of "Verify". The word "Mensayi" is also not a standard word and is likely a misspelling or corruption of "Message".

The correct translation should be:
Verify Message
```

```
        <source>Please check the address and try again.</source>
        <translation>Maliaring pakilawe pasibayu ing address at pasibayuan ya iti.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is grammatically incorrect and doesn't convey the intended meaning clearly. The word "maliaring" seems out of place, and the sentence structure is awkward.

Correct translation: "Pakilala at subukan muli ang address."
```

```
        <source>Private key for the entered address is not available.</source>
        <translation>Ing private key para king milub a address, ala ya.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses informal phrasing that is inappropriate for a technical context like Bitcoin. A more formal and direct translation is needed.

Correct translation: Ing private key para king milub a address ali ya kailangan.
```

```
        <source>Message signing failed.</source>
        <translation>Me-mali ya ing pamag-pirma king mensayi .</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic due to a spacing issue. The word "Me-mali" should be separated from "ya".
Me-mali ya ing pamag-pirma king mensayi.
```

```
        <source>Please check the signature and try again.</source>
        <translation>Maliaring pakilawe pasibayu ing pirma kaibat pasibayuan ya iti.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning of checking the signature. The phrase "pasibayuan ya iti" seems to mean "it was updated" or "it was renewed," which is not relevant to checking a signature.

Correct translation: "Pakisuri kang pasibayu ing pirma at subukan mong muli."
```

```
        <source>Message verification failed.</source>
        <translation>Me-mali ya ing pamag-beripika king mensayi.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning accurately. The phrasing "Me-mali ya ing pamag-beripika king mensayi" is awkward and doesn't directly translate to "Message verification failed."

A more appropriate translation would be:
"Me-mali ing pamag-beripika ning mensayi."
```

```
        <source>To</source>
        <translation>Para kang</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning of "To".
Correct translation: Para sa
```

```
        <source>not accepted</source>
        <translation>ali metanggap</translation>
    
YES, The provided translation is incorrect. The correct translation for "not accepted" in this context should be something similar to "dili dawaton" or "wala ginbaton".

The word "metanggap" means "received" or "accepted" and is the opposite of "not accepted".

Correct translation: dili dawaton
```

```
        <source>Net amount</source>
        <translation>Alaga dareng eganagana</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "Alaga dareng eganagana" does not accurately translate "Net amount". It seems to be a nonsensical or incorrect phrase in the target language.

A more appropriate translation for "Net amount" in a financial or transactional context would be:

<translation>Netong balor</translation>
```

```
        <source>Message</source>
        <translation>Mensayi</translation>
    
YES. The translation is incorrect. The correct translation for "Message" in Pam is "Mensaje".
YES. The translation is incorrect. The correct translation for "Message" in Pam is "Mensaje".
```

```
        <source>Transaction ID</source>
        <translation>ID</translation>
    
YES - The translation is too brief and lacks context. The correct translation should reflect "Transaction ID".
Correct translation: Transaction ID
```

```
        <source>true</source>
        <translation>tutu</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect. The word "true" translates to "matue" in the 'pam' language.
Correct translation: matue
```

```
        <source>false</source>
        <translation>e tutu</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The word "false" translates to "malo" in pam.
malo
```

```
        <source>This pane shows a detailed description of the transaction</source>
        <translation>Ining pane a ini magpakit yang detalyadung description ning transaksion</translation>
    
YES: The translation is not a correct translation of the source text. The words used appear to be a mix of Filipino (Tagalog) and Kapampangan. The Kapampangan translation for the source text should be "Ing pane a ini miliyag yang detalyadung deskripsion ning transaksion."
Here is the corrected translation:

<translation>Ing pane a ini miliyag yang detalyadung deskripsion ning transaksion</translation>
```

```
        <source>Received with</source>
        <translation>Atanggap kayabe ning</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The Pam translation has an incorrect translation.
Correct translation: Natanggap kayabe ning
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES: The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text "(no label)" implies the absence of a label, while the translation "(alang label)" suggests the presence of a label named "alang", which is incorrect and potentially misleading in a Bitcoin context.
(walay label)
```

```
        <source>Transaction status. Hover over this field to show number of confirmations.</source>
        <translation>Status ning Transaksion: Itapat me babo na ning field a ini ban ipakit dala reng bilang dareng me-kumpirma na</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses the word "babo" which is a Kapampangan word for "head" or "top". In this context, it should be translated to "on" or "over" to accurately convey the meaning of hovering over a field. The use of "dala reng" is also grammatically incorrect for this context.

Correct translation: Transaction status. Hover over this field to show number of confirmations. -> Status ning Transaksion: Itapat me keng field a ini ban ipakit la reng bilang dareng me-kumpirma na.
```

```
        <source>Date and time that the transaction was received.</source>
        <translation>Aldo at oras nung kapilan me tanggap ya ing transaksion</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning. The phrase "Aldo at oras nung kapilan me tanggap ya ing transaksion" roughly translates to "Day and time when we received the transaction," which is close but not a direct or natural translation of "Date and time that the transaction was received."

A more accurate and natural translation in the context of Bitcoin would be:

<translation>Petsa at oras kung kailan natanggap ang transaksyon.</translation>
```

```
        <source>Received with</source>
        <translation>Atanggap kayabe ning</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The Pam translation has an incorrect translation.
Correct translation: Natanggap kayabe ning
```

```
        <source>Range:</source>
        <translation>Angga:</translation>
    
YES
The Pam translation is incorrect. The word "Angga" does not translate to "Range". A more appropriate translation for "Range" in this context would be "Sakop" or "Had".

Correct translation: Sakop:
```

```
        <source>to</source>
        <translation>para kang</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The word "to" in this context should be translated to "sa" or "kay" depending on the grammatical structure. The provided translation "para kang" means "you are like" or "you seem like" in Tagalog, which is completely unrelated.
Correct translation: sa
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>IExport</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and should be "Eksport".
YES, Eksport
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Export me ing data king tab a ini anting metung a file</translation>
    
YES. The translation is nonsensical and contains no recognizable words from any known language. The format specifiers are also missing from the translation.
Correct translation: "Export the data in the current tab to a file"
```

```
        <source>Corrupted block database detected</source>
        <translation>Mekapansin lang me-corrupt a block database</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses informal language ("mekapansin lang me-corrupt") which is inappropriate for a technical error message. It should be more direct and formal.

Correct translation: Nakita na may sira ang block database.
```

```
        <source>Error opening block database</source>
        <translation>Kamalian king pamag buklat king block database</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The Tagalog word for "opening" is "pagbuklat" or "pagbubukas". The translation provided, "pamag buklat", is not a standard Tagalog word. The correct translation should be "Kamalian sa pagbuklat ng block database".

NO
```

```
        <source>Failed to listen on any port. Use -listen=0 if you want this.</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing pamakiramdam kareng gang nanung port. Gamita me ini -listen=0 nung buri me ini.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The Pamglish translation of "listen" as "pamakiramdam" (which means "feeling" or "perception") is incorrect in the context of networking or software. The correct term should relate to actively listening for connections.

NO
```

```
        <source>Transaction too large</source>
        <translation>Maragul yang masiadu ing transaksion</translation>
    
YES. The translation is erroneous. The word 'maliadu' should be 'malubay'. The correct translation is: "Maragul yang masiadu ing transaksion".
```
