        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>Kopyan me ing makalage address king system clipboard</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains minor issues: "address" should be translated or adapted properly if the language has a specific term, otherwise it can stay as is. "Kopyan me ing makalage address king system clipboard" is somewhat understandable but slightly awkward. The phrase "makalage" seems to be "selected" or "highlighted," but "currently selected" might be better translated more precisely.

Also, consider the phrase "king system clipboard" – "king" meaning "in" or "to" is correct, but consistent spacing should be checked.

A more precise translation would be:  
"Kopyan deng makalage a address king system clipboard"  
("Copy the selected address to the system clipboard")

If "address" is commonly used as is, it can remain.

Corrected translation:  
Kopyan deng makalage a address king system clipboard
```

```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>Ilako me ing kasalungsungang makalage address king listaan</translation>
    
YES  
The translation incorrectly mixes languages and has untranslated or unclear parts ("Ilako me ing kasalungsungang makalage" does not correspond well to the source text). The word "address" and "listaan" seem borrowed from English or Tagalog but may be acceptable in context if they are common loanwords in 'pam'. However, the phrase lacks clarity and correctness.

A better translation in Kapampangan (pam) would be:  
"Burakan ya ing makalage a address king listaan"  
(This means: "Delete the currently selected address from the list")
```

UNK_LANG, not familiar with the Kapampangan language 'pam'.
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>IExport</translation>
    
YES
The translation "IExport" incorrectly includes a capital "I" attached to the English word "Export," which is not appropriate for 'pam' (Kapampangan) or a proper translation. The correct translation for "Export" in Kapampangan is simply "I-export," using a hyphen and lowercase 'i', which is the common verb prefix in Kapampangan.

Correct translation:
I-export
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Mamili kang address a mamarlang coins</translation>
    
YES
The translation mixes English and 'pam' language words ("address" and "coins" are left untranslated), which is inconsistent and problematic. The phrase should be fully translated into Kapampangan ('pam' language), avoiding English words unless they are commonly used loanwords. Also, "mamarlang" seems to mean "to send," but the phrase structure could be more natural.

Correct translation:
"Pili kang address a padalang gagamit deng coins"

(Note: If "address" and "coins" have no direct translation, ensure consistent use of loanwords and proper syntax.)
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "(alang label)" is incorrect. In Kapampangan ('pam'), "no" is typically translated as "ala" or "alang" can be acceptable as a negation meaning "no" or "without." However, the phrase "(no label)" in this context means "(no label)" as in "no label assigned," so it should reflect "no" or "without" plus the word for "label" properly.

If "label" is borrowed, it might be okay, but "alang" should be corrected to "ala" which is more common for negation in Kapampangan.

A better translation would be:
(ala label)
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing pamag-encrypt king wallet </translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains extra trailing whitespace after "wallet" and the phrase "pamag-encrypt" is a partial anglicism mixed with local language, which might be acceptable depending on the usage, but the extra whitespace is definitely problematic. Also, the phrase could be more concise if the local term for "encryption" is used throughout.  

Correct translation:  
Memali ya ing pamag-encrypt king wallet
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing encryption uli na ning ausan dang internal error. E ya me-encrypt ing wallet yu.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains unnecessary English words ("encryption," "internal error," "wallet," "encrypt") mixed with 'pam' language, reducing clarity and naturalness. Also, the phrase structure is awkward and partially translated. A better translation should fully convey the message in the 'pam' language, avoid redundant English insertions, and maintain accuracy.

Correct translation (suggested):  
"Memali ya pagse kan ing wallet alang makasambut ning lekam a kamali. E ala ne me-encrypt ing wallet mu."
```

```
        <source>The supplied passphrases do not match.</source>
        <translation>E la mitutugma ring mibieng passphrase</translation>
    
YES
The translation is somewhat unclear and may contain grammatical issues. The phrase "do not match" should be clearly conveyed in the language. A more accurate translation would ensure the negative agreement is clear and the sentence is natural.

Correct translation:  
E la mitutugma ring mibie a passphrase
```

```
        <source>Wallet unlock failed</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing pamag-unlock king wallet </translation>
    
YES  
The translation has unnecessary trailing whitespace after "wallet". Also, the phrase "Memali ya ing pamag-unlock king wallet" mixes English "unlock" and "wallet" untranslated, which may be acceptable depending on borrowing, but ideally these terms should be either consistently translated or borrowed. However, since "pam" appears to use code-switching in technical contexts, this might be acceptable. Still, the extra space at the end is incorrect and should be removed.

Correct translation:  
Memali ya ing pamag-unlock king wallet
```

```
        <source>Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.</source>
        <translation>Mi-alilan ne ing passphrase na ning wallet.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation does not correctly convey that the wallet passphrase was "successfully changed." The original English sentence indicates a completed action with success, whereas the translation provided seems incomplete or incorrect in meaning.

Correct translation:  
Passphrase ning wallet ay na-alilan nang maayos.
```

```
        <source>Quit application</source>
        <translation>Tuknangan ing aplikasyon</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Tuknangan ing aplikasyon" is inaccurate in the context of "Quit application." The correct translation should convey the action of exiting or closing the application, rather than "tuknangan" which is not appropriate here.  

A better translation would be:  
"Ubusan ing aplikasyon"  
or  
"Isarak ing aplikasyon"  

Both mean "Quit application" or "Exit application" in Kapampangan (the 'pam' language).
```

```
        <source>Tabs toolbar</source>
        <translation>Gamit para king Tabs</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Gamit para king Tabs" appears to mix another language (likely Kapampangan, a language spoken in the Philippines) rather than 'pam' which is the code for Pampanga language (Kapampangan). However, considering pam is Kapampangan, the phrase is understandable but somewhat literal and not common for UI terms. Specifically, "Tabs toolbar" refers to a toolbar that contains tabs. A more accurate and natural translation in Kapampangan would be:

"Toolbar da reng Tabs" 

or

"Toolbar ning Tabs"

This keeps the English computer term "toolbar" (commonly used in localized computing contexts) combined with Kapampangan possessive construction and plural "Tabs." Alternatively, if "toolbar" is to be translated, it should be consistent and meaningful in Kapampangan.

Hence the currently provided translation is somewhat literal and potentially unclear for users.

Correct translation:
Toolbar ning Tabs
```

```
        <source>Command-line options</source>
        <translation>Pipamilian command-line</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has a word order issue and does not fully translate "Command-line options." The word "command-line" is left in English, and "Pipamilian" appears to be a partial or incorrect form for "options." In Kapampangan (pam), a more accurate translation would fully translate the phrase.

Correct translation:  
"Pagpipamilian king command-line"  
(or if "command-line" is kept as is, the phrase should still properly reflect "options" as "Pagpipamilian" or "Pipamilian" without stray spacing)
```

```
        <source>Last received block was generated %1 ago.</source>
        <translation>Ing tatauling block a metanggap,  me-generate ya %1 ing milabas</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has spacing issues and some incorrect or unnatural phrasing. For example, "Ing tatauling block a metanggap," should be "Ing tahuling block a metanggap," (correct spelling for 'last'), and "me-generate ya %1 ing milabas" mixes English and local language elements awkwardly ("me-generate" is a direct borrowing and may not be correct or natural). A better phrasing would be fully native or clearer.

Correct translation:  
Ing tahuling block a metanggap ya me-generate %1 ing milabas.
```

```
        <source>Up to date</source>
        <translation>Makatuki ya king aldo</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Makatuki ya king aldo" appears to be erroneous or nonsensical in the context of "Up to date." It does not correctly convey the meaning of being current or fully updated, which is what "Up to date" means in the context of Bitcoin software synchronization or status.

A better 'pam' translation for "Up to date" would be:  
**"Kasalukuyan o napapanahon"**

(Note: Since 'pam' refers to Kapampangan, in which "Kasalukuyan" means current or up to date, this is a more appropriate translation.)
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Kopyan ing alaga</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Kopyan ing alaga" is problematic. "Copy amount" in the Bitcoin context refers to copying the numeric value of an amount, not copying "alaga" which means "pet" or "care" in Kapampangan ('pam'). The word "alaga" is incorrect here.

A more accurate translation would be:  
"Kopyan ing halaga"  

Here, "halaga" means "amount" or "value" in Kapampangan.
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "(alang label)" is incorrect. In Kapampangan ('pam'), "no" is typically translated as "ala" or "alang" can be acceptable as a negation meaning "no" or "without." However, the phrase "(no label)" in this context means "(no label)" as in "no label assigned," so it should reflect "no" or "without" plus the word for "label" properly.

If "label" is borrowed, it might be okay, but "alang" should be corrected to "ala" which is more common for negation in Kapampangan.

A better translation would be:
(ala label)
```

```
        <source>Edit receiving address</source>
        <translation>Alilan ya ing address king pamagpadala</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes English ("address") with the target language and partially transliterates or uses borrowed words without clear adaptation. Also, it lacks clarity and may not accurately convey "Edit receiving address" in 'pam'. A more accurate translation should fully render the phrase in kapampangan, maintaining meaning and clarity.

Correct translation:  
"I-edit ing tanggapan a address"  
(or, depending on local usage: "Editan ing address a tatanggap")
```

```
        <source>New key generation failed.</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing pamangaua king key</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Memali ya ing pamangaua king key" does not accurately convey "New key generation failed." and contains an untranslated English word "key." Also, the grammar and word choice seem incorrect or confusing for the intended meaning.  

A better translation would be:  
"Pamamugus ning bayung yabe e naki-palyari."  

(This assumes 'pamangaua' relates to generation, 'ing' as a linker, 'key' should be properly translated or borrowed clearly. 'E naki-palyari' means 'has failed.')
```

```
        <source>version</source>
        <translation>bersion</translation>
    
YES
The translation "bersion" is incorrect and appears to be a typographical error or a misspelling of the English word "version." The correct translation should be the equivalent of "version" in the 'pam' language, but if 'pam' is closely related to Tagalog or Kapampangan, often loanwords are similar or the English word is used as-is. However, the misspelling with "b" instead of "v" is clearly incorrect.

Correct translation:
version
```

```
        <source>Command-line options</source>
        <translation>Pipamilian command-line</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has a word order issue and does not fully translate "Command-line options." The word "command-line" is left in English, and "Pipamilian" appears to be a partial or incorrect form for "options." In Kapampangan (pam), a more accurate translation would fully translate the phrase.

Correct translation:  
"Pagpipamilian king command-line"  
(or if "command-line" is kept as is, the phrase should still properly reflect "options" as "Pagpipamilian" or "Pipamilian" without stray spacing)
```

```
        <source>Unit to show amounts in:</source>
        <translation>Ing Unit a ipakit king alaga ning:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains some unnecessary spacing issues ("Ing Unit a ipakit king alaga ning:"). Also, the translation does not correctly convey the intended meaning likely due to direct word substitution. A better translation would ensure that the concept "Unit to show amounts in:" (referring to units in which amounts are displayed, e.g., BTC, mBTC) is clearly expressed.  

A corrected version (assuming "unit" is untranslated or translated as "fungsi" or "unit" and "show amounts" is properly rendered):  

Correct translation:  
"Ing unit a gagamitin para ipakit ang halaga king:"  

Note: If "pam" refers to Kapampangan (Pampanga language), this is a more natural phrasing.
```

```
        <source>The supplied proxy address is invalid.</source>
        <translation>Ing milageng proxy address eya katanggap-tanggap.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a mix of Tagalog/Filipino ("Ing", "katanggap-tanggap") and is not in Kapampangan ('pam'). Also, "address" is not translated or adapted, and "proxy address" as a technical term should be carefully translated. The phrase means "The supplied proxy address is invalid," but "katanggap-tanggap" means "acceptable," which is the opposite meaning of "invalid." Therefore, the translation is incorrect both linguistically and semantically.

Correct translation in Kapampangan (pam):  
"Ing ipinamigay a proxy address ali ya balu."  
(or)  
"Ing ipinamalakad a proxy address e ya balu."  

"Ali ya balu" means "is not valid/invalid."
```

```
        <source>The displayed information may be out of date. Your wallet automatically synchronizes with the Bitcoin network after a connection is established, but this process has not completed yet.</source>
        <translation>Ing makaltong impormasion mapalyaring luma ne. Ing kekang wallet otomatiku yang mag-synchronize keng Bitcoin network istung mekakonekta ne king network, oneng ing prosesung ini ali ya pa kumpletu.</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains some spacing issues with repeated spaces and some minor phrasing inconsistencies that might affect clarity. Also, "istung mekakonekta ne king network" translates roughly to "when connected to the network," which could be more naturally phrased, and "ali ya pa kumpletu" is a bit informal and unclear.

A more natural and clear translation would be:

Ing makaltong impormasion mapalyaring luma ne. Ing kekang wallet otomatiku yang mag-synchronize keng Bitcoin network nung metung yang koneksion king network, alayu pa reng prosesung ini para kumpletu.

This version maintains proper spacing, clearer phrasing, and conveys the meaning accurately.
```

```
        <source>Your current total balance</source>
        <translation>Ing kekang kasalungsungan kabuuang balanse</translation>
    
YES  
The translation uses Kapampangan (pam) language but the source text in English is "Your current total balance." The translation "Ing kekang kasalungsungan kabuuang balanse" correctly conveys "Your current total balance" meaning-wise but contains a spacing issue and a mixing of Kapampangan and Tagalog.

- "kabuuang" is Tagalog, while the rest is Kapampangan. For purity and consistency, either fully Kapampangan or Tagalog should be used.
- "kasalungsungan" means "current" in Kapampangan.
- "kabuuang" means "total" but is a Tagalog word.
- "balanse" is borrowed from Spanish and is used in both languages.

A fully Kapampangan translation might be:

"Ing kekang kasalungsungan kabuuan a balanse"

or

"Ing kekang kasalungsungan kabuuang balanse" (acceptable but mixing)

Alternatively, if the translator intended to keep kabuuang, spacing and flow are correct.

No format specifiers are involved.

Given the mixture and potential lack of consistency, it is best to correct to pure Kapampangan.

Correct translation (pure Kapampangan):

"Ing kekang kasalungsungan kabuuan a balanse"

(Note: "kabuuan" is Kapampangan for "total".)

Hence:

YES  
The translation mixes Kapampangan and Tagalog terms, reducing clarity. A consistent Kapampangan translation is:  
"Ing kekang kasalungsungan kabuuan a balanse"
```

```
        <source>Client version</source>
        <translation>Bersion ning Cliente</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains errors: "Bersion" should be "Bersyon" (version), and "ning Cliente" uses "Cliente," which is a Spanish loanword; a more appropriate term in Kapampangan (language code 'pam') would be "kliente" or "klayente." The correct translation should be:

Bersyon ning Kliente
```

```
        <source>To</source>
        <translation>Para kang</translation>
    
YES  
The English source "To" is a short, likely standalone preposition often used in contexts such as "To address," "To send," or simply indicating direction or recipient. The translation "Para kang" is Tagalog or a related Filipino language phrase meaning "for the," which is longer and more specific than just "To." The language code 'pam' refers to Kapampangan, a Philippine language, but "Para kang" is not correct Kapampangan and seems out of place, suggesting a possible confusion with Tagalog or another language.

Also, the translation is not a faithful equivalent of the simple English preposition "To" and may be contextually incorrect.

Correct translation (Kapampangan) for "To" in this context would commonly be:

<translation>Para</translation> 

If more specificity is needed, it depends on usage, but "Para" suffices as "To" in most cases.

Hence, correction:

<translation>Para</translation>
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "(alang label)" is incorrect. In Kapampangan ('pam'), "no" is typically translated as "ala" or "alang" can be acceptable as a negation meaning "no" or "without." However, the phrase "(no label)" in this context means "(no label)" as in "no label assigned," so it should reflect "no" or "without" plus the word for "label" properly.

If "label" is borrowed, it might be okay, but "alang" should be corrected to "ala" which is more common for negation in Kapampangan.

A better translation would be:
(ala label)
```

```
        <source>Clear All</source>
        <translation>I-Clear Eganagana</translation>
    
YES
The translation mixes English ("I-Clear") with a non-English term, leading to inconsistency and potential confusion. A fully translated and appropriate phrase in 'pam' should be used, or if a direct equivalent does not exist, it should be clearly indicated. As 'pam' is Kapampangan, a more natural translation for "Clear All" would be:

"Buruan Lahat"
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Kopyan ing alaga</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Kopyan ing alaga" is problematic. "Copy amount" in the Bitcoin context refers to copying the numeric value of an amount, not copying "alaga" which means "pet" or "care" in Kapampangan ('pam'). The word "alaga" is incorrect here.

A more accurate translation would be:  
"Kopyan ing halaga"  

Here, "halaga" means "amount" or "value" in Kapampangan.
```

        <translation>Ing kabuuan mipasobra ya king kekang balanse istung inabe ya ing %1 a bayad king transaksion </translation>
    
YES  
The translation has extra spaces at the end, and the phrase structure is somewhat awkward and informal. Also, the format specifier %1 is correctly included but should be immediately followed by the noun without extra spacing or insertion errors. The original meaning — "The total exceeds your balance when the %1 transaction fee is included." — is not clearly and accurately conveyed.

A more accurate and cleaner translation would be:  
"Ing kabuuan mipasobra king kekang balanse nung isali ya ing %1 a bayad king transaksion."
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "(alang label)" is incorrect. In Kapampangan ('pam'), "no" is typically translated as "ala" or "alang" can be acceptable as a negation meaning "no" or "without." However, the phrase "(no label)" in this context means "(no label)" as in "no label assigned," so it should reflect "no" or "without" plus the word for "label" properly.

If "label" is borrowed, it might be okay, but "alang" should be corrected to "ala" which is more common for negation in Kapampangan.

A better translation would be:
(ala label)
```

```
        <source>Signatures - Sign / Verify a Message</source>
        <translation>Pirma - Pirman / I-beripika ing mensayi</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains errors and inconsistent transliterations. The English word "Signatures" is translated as "Pirma," which seems incorrect in the context of the 'pam' language or Kapampangan. The translated terms "Pirman" and "I-beripika ing mensayi" appear to be borrowed from other languages or misspelled.

A better translation in Kapampangan ('pam') would be:

Signatures - Lagyu / Beripikayan ne ning Mensayi

Explanation:
- "Signatures" can be translated as "Lagu" (sign) or "Lagyu" (signature).
- "Sign" as a verb is "Pirman" or "Lagyu" (to sign).
- "Verify" corresponds to "Beripikayan."
- "Message" is "Mensayi."

Therefore, the corrected translation is:

Pirma - Pirman / Beripikayan ne ning Mensayi
```

```
        <source>Reset all sign message fields</source>
        <translation>Ibalik keng dati reng ngan fields keng pamamirmang mensayi</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a mix of languages (likely Kapampangan mixed with Tagalog or another language) and some awkward phrasing. Also, "fields" is left in English and "sign message" is not clearly translated, which could cause confusion in the Bitcoin context. A clearer translation in Kapampangan would be:  

Correct translation:  
"Ibalik king dati ang eganaganang sign message a patse"  

or if "sign message fields" refers to the fields used to sign a message, it would be better to translate both "sign message" and "fields" properly.
```

```
        <source>Clear All</source>
        <translation>I-Clear Eganagana</translation>
    
YES
The translation mixes English ("I-Clear") with a non-English term, leading to inconsistency and potential confusion. A fully translated and appropriate phrase in 'pam' should be used, or if a direct equivalent does not exist, it should be clearly indicated. As 'pam' is Kapampangan, a more natural translation for "Clear All" would be:

"Buruan Lahat"
```

```
        <source>Verify the message to ensure it was signed with the specified Bitcoin address</source>
        <translation>Beripikan ing mensayi ban asiguradu a me pirma ya ini gamit ing mepiling Bitcoin address</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has minor spelling and grammar issues: "Beripikan" should be "Beripika" (correct imperative form of "verify"), "asiguradu a me" is awkward and should be "asiguradu na" (to ensure that). Also, "gamit ing mepiling Bitcoin address" is acceptable but could be clearer as "gamit ang napiling Bitcoin address" for better clarity.

Correct translation:  
Beripika ing mensayi ban asiguradu na me pirma ya ini gamit ang napiling Bitcoin address
```

```
        <source>Private key for the entered address is not available.</source>
        <translation>Ing private key para king milub a address, ala ya.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains substantial errors and unnatural phrasing. Words like "Ing" and "milub a" are not correct or coherent in Kapampangan (pam). Also, the phrase structure is incorrect and does not clearly convey the meaning: "Private key for the entered address is not available."

A better Kapampangan translation would be:  
"Ala yang pribadu a susi para king ipinasuk a address."

This preserves the meaning and reads naturally in pam.
```

```
        <source>Message signing failed.</source>
        <translation>Me-mali ya ing pamag-pirma king mensayi .</translation>
    
YES  
There is a stray space before the period in the translation ("mensayi ."). Also, the translation should maintain concise spacing without extra spaces before punctuation.  

Correct translation:  
Me-mali ya ing pamag-pirma king mensayi.
```

```
        <source>To</source>
        <translation>Para kang</translation>
    
YES  
The English source "To" is a short, likely standalone preposition often used in contexts such as "To address," "To send," or simply indicating direction or recipient. The translation "Para kang" is Tagalog or a related Filipino language phrase meaning "for the," which is longer and more specific than just "To." The language code 'pam' refers to Kapampangan, a Philippine language, but "Para kang" is not correct Kapampangan and seems out of place, suggesting a possible confusion with Tagalog or another language.

Also, the translation is not a faithful equivalent of the simple English preposition "To" and may be contextually incorrect.

Correct translation (Kapampangan) for "To" in this context would commonly be:

<translation>Para</translation> 

If more specificity is needed, it depends on usage, but "Para" suffices as "To" in most cases.

Hence, correction:

<translation>Para</translation>
```

```
        <source>not accepted</source>

The translation "ali metanggap" appears incorrect and resembles Indonesian/Malay rather than Kapampangan (pam). The English phrase "not accepted" should be translated accurately into Kapampangan. A more correct Kapampangan translation for "not accepted" is: "e tinanggap" or "ali tinanggap".

Correct translation:  
<translation>ali tinanggap</translation>
```

```
        <source>Net amount</source>
        <translation>Alaga dareng eganagana</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Alaga dareng eganagana" does not accurately convey the meaning of "Net amount" in the Bitcoin context. The phrase is unclear or incorrect in 'pam' language.  

A better translation in 'pam' for "Net amount" (the amount after all deductions) would be:  
"Netto konektura" or "Netto kantidad" (depending on local usage), but since exact terms vary, a literal usage with recognizable loanwords for "net" and "amount" would be preferable.

If these are not acceptable, a more precise translation could be:  
"Net alaga"  

So a corrected version might be:  
<translation>Net alaga</translation>
```

```
        <source>Transaction ID</source>
        <translation>ID</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incomplete and inaccurate. The source text "Transaction ID" should be fully translated or at least preserved as "ID ng Transaksyon" or a complete equivalent in 'pam', not shortened to just "ID".

Correct translation:
Transaksyon ID
```

```
        <source>false</source>
        <translation>e tutu</translation>
    
YES  
The English word "false" in a Bitcoin context should be translated to a word meaning "not true" or "incorrect." The provided translation "e tutu" does not correspond to "false." The correct translation for false in 'pam' language (Kapampangan) is "ali" or "e metung" depending on dialect and context, but commonly "ali" is used for "not" or "false."

Correct translation:  
<translation>ali</translation>
```

```
        <source>Received with</source>
        <translation>Atanggap kayabe ning</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes Tagalog ("Atanggap") and Kapampangan ("kayabe ning"), which is inconsistent. The language code 'pam' stands for Kapampangan, so the entire translation should be in Kapampangan only. A correct Kapampangan translation for "Received with" would be:

"Katunggaling kayabe ning"
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(alang label)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "(alang label)" is incorrect. In Kapampangan ('pam'), "no" is typically translated as "ala" or "alang" can be acceptable as a negation meaning "no" or "without." However, the phrase "(no label)" in this context means "(no label)" as in "no label assigned," so it should reflect "no" or "without" plus the word for "label" properly.

If "label" is borrowed, it might be okay, but "alang" should be corrected to "ala" which is more common for negation in Kapampangan.

A better translation would be:
(ala label)
```

```
        <source>Transaction status. Hover over this field to show number of confirmations.</source>
        <translation>Status ning Transaksion: Itapat me babo na ning field a ini ban ipakit dala reng bilang dareng me-kumpirma na</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains some issues affecting clarity and correctness. The phrase "Hover over this field to show number of confirmations" is translated as "Itapat me babo na ning field a ini ban ipakit dala reng bilang dareng me-kumpirma na," which is confusing and uses awkward phrasing. A more natural and accurate translation in Pampangan would be:  

Status ning transaksion. Itapat ku ing cursor king field a ini para ipakit ing bilang da reng kumpirmasion.
```

```
        <source>Received with</source>
        <translation>Atanggap kayabe ning</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes Tagalog ("Atanggap") and Kapampangan ("kayabe ning"), which is inconsistent. The language code 'pam' stands for Kapampangan, so the entire translation should be in Kapampangan only. A correct Kapampangan translation for "Received with" would be:

"Katunggaling kayabe ning"
```

```
        <source>to</source>
        <translation>para kang</translation>
    
YES
The English source "to" is a very short and context-dependent preposition that typically translates to a single word in most languages. The provided translation "para kang" appears to be a phrase consisting of two words, which is unusual and likely inaccurate for a simple preposition like "to." It may also introduce incorrect spacing or conveys a meaning different from the simple directional or relational preposition.

Correct translation (suggested based on the common use of "to" as a preposition in Filipino languages related to 'pam', Kapampangan):  
"king"

If "pam" is Kapampangan (Pangasinan or Pampangan), "king" is a typical preposition equivalent to "to" in English.  
Alternatively, if a specific dialect variation is expected, a single suitable word should be used rather than a phrase.

Corrected translation:  
<translation>king</translation>
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>IExport</translation>
    
YES
The translation "IExport" incorrectly includes a capital "I" attached to the English word "Export," which is not appropriate for 'pam' (Kapampangan) or a proper translation. The correct translation for "Export" in Kapampangan is simply "I-export," using a hyphen and lowercase 'i', which is the common verb prefix in Kapampangan.

Correct translation:
I-export
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Export me ing data king tab a ini anting metung a file</translation>
    
UNK_LANG, not familiar with the Kapampangan language 'pam'.
```

```
        <source>Error opening block database</source>
        <translation>Kamalian king pamag buklat king block database</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is partly incorrect and awkward. "Kamalian" means "error," and "king" means "in" or "on," but "pamag buklat" is not a correct phrase for "opening" in the context of opening a database. A better translation should clearly convey an error occurring while opening the block database, using proper Pam phraseology for "opening" or "accessing."

Correct translation:  
Kamalian king pamagbukas ning block database
```

```
        <source>Failed to listen on any port. Use -listen=0 if you want this.</source>
        <translation>Memali ya ing pamakiramdam kareng gang nanung port. Gamita me ini -listen=0 nung buri me ini.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Memali ya ing pamakiramdam kareng gang nanung port. Gamita me ini -listen=0 nung buri me ini." contains some inconsistencies and awkward phrasing. The word "gang nanung port" seems to be incorrect or redundant ("gang" may be a filler or error). The phrase "Gamita me ini" should be "Gamita ini" without "me" to be grammatically correct. The translation generally conveys the meaning but could be made clearer and more natural.  

Correct translation:  
"Memali ya ing pamakiramdam kareng aliwang port. Gamita ini -listen=0 nung buri mu ini."
