        <source>Change the passphrase used for wallet encryption</source>
        <translation>Muta tesseram utam pro cassidilis cifrando</translation>
    
YES
The Latin translation is problematic. The terms used are not accurate or classical for "change", "passphrase", "wallet", and "encryption". "Muta" is more "move" than "change", "tessera" is a suitable word for "password", but "utam" is ungrammatical, and "cassidilis" is not correct Latin for "wallet". "Cifrando" is an attempt at a modern loan for "encryption", but should be rendered more accurately.

Correct translation:
Mutare tesseram usitatam ad cassidilem cifrandam

Explanation:
- "Mutare" is an accurate infinitive for "change".
- "tesseram" for "passphrase."
- "usitatam" for "used".
- "ad cassidilem cifrandam" for "for encrypting the wallet", using a gerundive construction.
- If "cassidilem" is not attested, "sacculum" may work for "wallet" ("sacculum nummarium" for "coin purse"/wallet). 

Alternative:
Mutare tesseram ad sacculum cifrandum adhibitam

Either is more accurate and grammatical Latin.

```
        <source>Choose the default subdivision unit to show in the interface and when sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Selige praedefinitam unitam subdivisionis monstrare in interfacie et quando nummos mittere</translation>
    
YES
The translation has grammatical errors and awkward phrasing in Latin. "Selige" (imperative for 'choose'), "praedefinitam unitam subdivisionis" (should more accurately mean 'default subdivision unit'), "monstrare" (an infinitive, mismatched with the sentence imperative), and "et quando nummos mittere" (not well-formed).

Correct translation:
Selige praedefinitam unitatem subdivisionis quae in interfacie et ad nummos mittendos ostendatur.
```

        <source>Cannot start bitcoin: click-to-pay handler</source>
        <translation>Bitcoin incipere non potest: cliccare-ad-pensandum handler</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The Latin translation retains the English word "cliccare" (to click) and "handler" unaltered, which are not Latin. Furthermore, "pensandum" is an awkward neologism and the phrase does not conform to Latin norms.

Correct translation:
Bitcoin incipere non potest: curator solutionis per strepitum

Explanation: "curator" is a suitable Latin word for "handler", "solutionis" means "of payment", "per strepitum" (by clicking). If more precision is desired for "click-to-pay", one could use "ad solvendum strepitu" (to pay by click). Optional refinement depending on style.
