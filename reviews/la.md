```
        <source>Show general overview of wallet</source>
        <translation>Monstra generale summarium cassidilis</translation>
    
YES - The word "cassidilis" is not a valid Latin word. The correct translation for "wallet" in this context would be "sacculi" or "marsupii".

Monstra generale summarium sacculi
```

```
        <source>Transactions</source>
        <translation>Transactiones</translation>
    
YES: The translation has a spelling error. The correct translation for "Transactions" is "Transactiones".
```

```
        <source>Exit</source>
        <translation>Exi</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incomplete. The correct translation for "Exit" is "Exire".
        <source>Exit</source>
        <translation>Exi</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incomplete. The correct translation for "Exit" is "Exire".
```

```
        <source>Quit application</source>
        <translation>Exi applicatione</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because "Exi" is not a valid Latin word. The correct Latin word for "quit" or "exit" is "Exi" (imperative singular) or "Exite" (imperative plural). Given the context of quitting an application, "Exi" would be the appropriate imperative singular form.

The correct translation is:
Exi applicatione
```

```
        <source>Send coins to a Bitcoin address</source>
        <translation>Mitte nummos ad inscriptionem Bitcoin</translation>
    
YES - The Latin translation uses an incorrect word for "coins". The correct translation is "Nummi" for coins. The translation for address is also incorrect and should be "inscriptio". The correct translation is "Mitte nummos ad inscriptionem Bitcoin".
```

```
        <source>Change the passphrase used for wallet encryption</source>
        <translation>Muta tesseram utam pro cassidilis cifrando</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains erroneous content. The Latin translation is not accurate for the English source. The correct translation would be "Muta tesseram quae ad encryptionem crumenam adhibetur."
```

```
        <source>Send</source>
        <translation>Mitte</translation>
    
YES. The translation of "Send" to "Mitte" is incorrect in the context of Bitcoin transactions, as "Mitte" means "middle" or "center" in German. The correct Latin word for "send" is "Mitte" if used in the imperative form, however, the context implies a noun (e.g., "send money") or verb, where "Mitte" is not appropriate. The correct Latin translation for "Send" (as a command or action) would be "Mitte" if imperative or "mittere" if infinitive.

The correct translation would be:

        <source>Send</source>
        <translation>Mitte</translation>
```

```
        <source>Encrypt the private keys that belong to your wallet</source>
        <translation>Cifra claves privatas quae cassidili tui sunt</translation>
    
YES: The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The use of "cassidili tui sunt" is not standard Latin for "belong to your wallet."

Correct translation: Cifra claves privatas quae ad cassidilem tuum pertinent.
```

```
        <source>Settings</source>
        <translation>Configuratio</translation>
    
YES, The translation is erroneous. The correct translation should be "Configuratio" (Settings).
YES, Configuratio
```

```
        <source>%1 behind</source>
        <translation>%1 post</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. "Behind" in this context means "in the past", and "post" means "after". The correct translation should reflect a temporal distance.
%1 ago
```

```
        <source>Information</source>
        <translation>Informatio</translation>
    
YES: The translation is missing the last letter 'n' from the word "Information".
Correct translation: Information
```

```
        <source>Reset Options</source>
        <translation>Reconstitue Optiones</translation>
    
YES. The translation is inaccurate and uses a word that is not standard Latin for "reset".

Correct translation: Reintegra Rationes
```

```
        <source>Minimize to the tray instead of the taskbar</source>
        <translation>Minifac in tabellam systematis potius quam applicationum</translation>
    
YES, the translation is erroneous. The Latin words used do not accurately convey the meaning of "tray" and "taskbar" in the context of a computer interface.

The correct translation should be: "Minifac in scrinium potius quam in talea applicationum"
```

```
        <source>Choose the default subdivision unit to show in the interface and when sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Selige praedefinitam unitam subdivisionis monstrare in interfacie et quando nummos mittere</translation>
    
YES - The Latin translation uses "monstrare" (to show/demonstrate) where "praebere" (to provide/offer) would be more appropriate for "show in the interface". It also uses "nummos mittere" (to send money) instead of "nummos transmittere" (to transmit money/coins), which is more accurate in the context of Bitcoin transactions.

Corrected translation: Selige praedefinitam unitam subdivisionis praebere in interfacie et quando nummos transmittere.
```

```
        <source>Mined balance that has not yet matured</source>
        <translation>Fossum pendendum quod nondum maturum est</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses an incorrect word for "mined." "Fossum" means "ditch" or "pit." The correct translation for "mined" in the context of Bitcoin would be related to mining or extraction.

Correct translation: Pecunia inventa nondum matura est
```

```
        <source>Cannot start bitcoin: click-to-pay handler</source>
        <translation>Bitcoin incipere non potest: cliccare-ad-pensandum handler</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains erroneous content. The phrase "cliccare-ad-pensandum handler" is an incorrect and nonsensical Latinization. The word "pensandum" means "to be thought" or "to be weighed," not "to pay."

A more appropriate translation would be:

"Bitcoin incipere non potest: click-to-pay handler" or "Bitcoin incipere non potest: handler pro click-to-pay"
```
