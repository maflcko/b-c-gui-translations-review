# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Close</source>
        <translation>تاقا(L)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "تاقا(L)" is problematic. "تاقا" means "window" or sometimes "door" in Uyghur, which is incorrect in this context. The literal translation of "Close" in Uyghur, as used for closing a window or dialogue, is "ياپ" or "تاقاش".

Correct translation:
ياپ

If you must include a shortcut "(L)", ensure it's justified in context (for example, if "L" is actually the shortcut key, and if so, should be after the Uyghur word without English letters unless the UI requires it), e.g.:
ياپ(L) 

But typically, the correct and simple translation would be:
ياپ
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>تاللا(H)</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains an error: "تاللا(H)" is not the correct translation for "Choose". The added "(H)" appears extraneous and the verb is misspelled. The correct translation should be:

تاللا

If a shortcut key ("H") is being referenced, ensure it matches the English source or local UI practice. Otherwise, omit it.
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>ئادرېس كۆچۈر(C)</translation>
    
YES
The translation includes an unnecessary "(C)" at the end, which does not exist in the source and is not required. Also, "ئادرېس كۆچۈر" is an accurate translation for "Copy Address".

Correct translation:
ئادرېس كۆچۈر
```

```
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>ھۆججەت پەش بىلەن ئايرىلىدۇ</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. The provided 'ug' translation means "the document is separated by a whip" or "the document is separated by a stick", which is a mistranslation. The word for "comma" in Uyghur is "پەش". The correct translation for "Comma separated file" should be:

پەش بىلەن ئايرىلغان ھۆججەت
```

```
        <source>Change passphrase</source>
        <translation>ئىم ئىبارە ئۆزگەرت</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The correct translation for "Change passphrase" should be closer to "ئىم ئىبارىنى ئۆزگەرت," where "ئىم ئىبارە" means "passphrase" and "ئۆزگەرت" means "change." The current translation "ئىم ئىبارە ئۆزگەرت" is missing the possessive or object marker, so it reads as "passphrase change" rather than an imperative "Change passphrase."

Correct translation:
ئىم ئىبارىنى ئۆزگەرت
```

```
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>ھۆججەت پەش بىلەن ئايرىلىدۇ</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. The provided 'ug' translation means "the document is separated by a whip" or "the document is separated by a stick", which is a mistranslation. The word for "comma" in Uyghur is "پەش". The correct translation for "Comma separated file" should be:

پەش بىلەن ئايرىلغان ھۆججەت
