# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.

Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incomplete. The first sentence is partially translated into Breton ('br'), while the rest remains in English. Additionally, the translation introduces an unnatural construction compared to expected Breton sentence structures.

Correct translation (note: as an AI, I am not fluent in Breton, but an approximate translation based on Breton resources could be):

Setu amañ ho adresoù Bitcoin evit resev ar paeamantoù. Implijit ar bouton 'Krouiñ ur chomlec'h degemer nevez' e teblad degemer evit krouiñ chomlec'hioù nevez.
N'haller sinañ nemet gant adresoù ar rizh 'legacy'. 

If a native Breton speaker review is available, it would further refine accuracy.

        <source>Receive</source>
        <translation>Resev</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Resev" is incorrect for the Breton language ('br') and appears to be either a typo or a direct misspelling. The proper Breton translation for "Receive" is "Resev" (likely a typo for "Resev"), but more accurately, "Resev" appears to be ungrammatical. The correct Breton term would be "Degemer".

Correct translation:
Degemer

        <source>Wallet</source>
        <translation>Doug-moneiz</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Doug-moneiz" is not correct in Breton ('br'). It appears to be a non-existent or made-up word and does not correspond to the concept of "wallet" in the context of Bitcoin. The Breton word for wallet is "godel" or, in digital context, you might use "godel ar moneiz" or possibly "walet" (Breton sometimes borrows modern technical terms).

Correct translation:
Godel
```

```
        <source> GB</source>
        <translation> Ge</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. "GB" likely stands for "Gigabytes", and in Breton ('br'), the translation should stay as an international abbreviation or, if localized, should match Breton conventions. "Ge" is not a valid abbreviation for Gigabytes in Breton and appears erroneous.

Correct translation:
 GB

        <source>From</source>

        <source>Error: Cannot extract destination from the generated scriptpubkey</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Cannot extract destination from the generated scriptpubkey</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incomplete: 'Cannot extract destination from the generated scriptpubkey' remains untranslated in English. Only 'Error' is translated to 'Fazi', which is correct for Breton, but the rest is not.

Correct translation:
Fazi : N'haller ket tennañ an dinoadur eus ar scriptpubkey krouet
```

```
        <source>Error: Couldn't create cursor into database</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Couldn't create cursor into database</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because it leaves the English phrase "Couldn't create cursor into database" untranslated after "Fazi:" (which is "Error" in Breton). This is not a full translation into 'br' (Breton).

Correct translation:
Fazi: N’haller ket krouiñ ur merker el lec’h-dedadoù

(Note: This is a reasonable Breton translation for the message.)
```

```
        <source>Error: Disk space is low for %s</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Disk space is low for %s</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because it is not translated into Breton ('br'). Only "Fazi" ("Error") appears to be in Breton, while the rest is untranslated English. 

Correct translation:
Fazi : n'eo ket a-walc'h plas war ar bladenn evit %s
```

        <source>Error: Dumpfile checksum does not match. Computed %s, expected %s</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Dumpfile checksum does not match. Computed %s, expected %s</translation>
    
YES
The translation copies most of the English text directly instead of translating it into 'br'. Also, "Fazi" is not the correct word for "Error" in Breton ('fazi' is indeed "error" in Breton, but the rest is untranslated).

Correct translation:
Fazi : n’eo ket heñvel kontrolennoù an teul ezkaset. Dalc’het %s, gortozet %s
```

```
        <source>Error: Failed to create new watchonly wallet</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Failed to create new watchonly wallet</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic for the following reasons:
- The Breton ('br') translation does not translate the error message. Only "Fazi" (which means "error" in Breton) is translated; the rest of the content remains in untranslated English.
- "watchonly wallet" should be translated or at least adapted appropriately.

Correct translation:
Fazi: N'eus ket bet gallet krouiñ ur yalc'had "gwelout hepken" nevez
```

```
        <source>Error: No %s addresses available.</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Adres %s hegerz ebet.</translation>

I am unfamiliar with the language code 'br', which stands for Breton. Unable to assess the translation.
```

```
        <source>Error: Unable to remove watchonly address book data</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Unable to remove watchonly address book data</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because it is only partially translated. "Fazi" is the Breton word for "Error," but the rest of the string remains in English and should be translated to Breton. Also, "watchonly address book data" should be rendered into Breton appropriately.

Correct translation:
Fazi : n’haller ket dilemel roadennoù levr-c’helenn ar chomlec’hioù sellet hepken
```

```
        <source>Error: Could not add watchonly tx %s to watchonly wallet</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Could not add watchonly tx %s to watchonly wallet</translation>
    
YES
The translation is only partly in Breton ('Fazi' for 'Error'), while the rest remains untranslated in English. The correct translation should be fully in Breton.

Correct translation:
Fazi: Ne oa ket tu da ouzhpennañ an treuzkasadenn watchonly %s d’ar gont-gwiriñ hepken
```
