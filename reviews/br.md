        <translation>Ezporzhiañ roadennoù an ivinell-mañ en ur rest</translation>
    
YES
There is a spelling error and a missing letter in the word "rest" (should be "restr" for "file" in Breton). The format specifiers are fine. Otherwise, the translation is understandable, but the typo makes it problematic.

Correct translation:
Ezporzhiañ roadennoù an ivinell-mañ en ur restr

        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Ho adresoù Bitcoin evit kas paeamantoù int. Gwirekaat ar sammad hag an adres a resev bewezh a-raok kas gwenneien.</translation>
    
YES
There are some issues with the translation:
- "Ho adresoù Bitcoin evit kas paeamantoù int." is awkward; "int" at the end is likely a mistranslation or leftover.
- "Gwirekaat ar sammad hag an adres a resev bewezh a-raok kas gwenneien." should be refined for clarity, accuracy, and to match the imperative form as in the source.
- The use of "gwenneien" for "coins" is not commonly used in Breton Bitcoin contexts; "moneiz" or "munizennoù" is more accurate.

Correct translation:
Setu ho troadoù Bitcoin evit kas peadra. Sellit atav ouzh ar sammad ha ouzh an trolad resev a-raok kas munizennoù.
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</source>
        <translation>Ho adresoù Bitcoin evit resev paeamantoù eo. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incomplete and contains English text mixed in with the Breton text. Only the first sentence is partially translated, and the rest remains untranslated. Additionally, the Breton translation provided ("Ho adresoù Bitcoin evit resev paeamantoù eo.") is missing the subject and is awkwardly phrased.

Correct translation:
Setu amañ ho adresoù Bitcoin evit resev peadraoù. Grit gant an afell 'Krouiñ ur chomlec'h resev nevez' war an ivinell resev evit krouiñ chomlec'hioù nevez.
An sinadur a c'haller d'ober gant ar chomlec'hioù 'legacy' nemetken.
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Eilañ Label</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Label" is not translated into Breton; it is left in English. The correct translation should be in Breton, and "Copy" is also not properly translated ("Eilañ" is not standard for "copy" in Breton; "Eilañ" can mean "to copy" as an infinitive, but the imperative or menu command can use "Eiladenn"/"Eilañ"/"Kopiañ"). A more appropriate translation would be:

Correct translation:
Eilañ an tikedenn

Or, more concisely for a menu command:
Kopiañ an tikedenn

("tikeden" is "label" in Breton; "kopiañ" is "to copy")
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(label ebet)</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. In Breton, "label" should be translated, and "ebet" means "none" or "no". The word "label" is an English loanword and is not typically used in this context in Breton. The proper translation would be:

Correct translation:
(skrid ebet)

Alternatively, "etikedenn" is the Breton word for "label", so:

(etikedenn ebet)

The translation should not use the English "label".
```

```
        <source>Error: %1</source>
        <translation>Fazi : %1</translation>
    
YES
There is an unnecessary space before the colon in the translation "Fazi : %1". In Breton, the correct punctuation does not add a space before the colon in this context.

Correct translation:
Fazi: %1
```

```
        <source>Exit</source>

UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Minimize</source>
        <translation>Bihanaat</translation>
    
YES
"Bihanaat" is not a correct translation of "Minimize" in Breton ('br'). It does not correspond to the action "to minimize" or "minimize" in the user interface context.

Correct translation:
Lakaat d’an nebeutañ

So, the correct translation is:
<translation>Lakaat d’an nebeutañ</translation>
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Doug-moneiz:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Doug-moneiz" is not correct for the Breton language ('br'). The correct term for "Wallet" in Breton is commonly "Logell-argant" or simply "Logell".

Correct translation:
Logell-argant:
```

```
        <source>Receive</source>
        <translation>Resev</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Resev" is incorrect for Breton ('br'). The correct translation for "Receive" in Breton is "Degemer" or "Resev" could be a typo of "Resev" in another language, but in Breton it should be "Degemer".

Correct translation:
Degemer
```

```
        <source>Error</source>
        <translation>Fazi</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Fazi" is not correct in Breton. The correct word for "Error" in Breton is "Fazi" (which matches here), but there is a potential ambiguity: "Fazi" means "error" in Breton, but in some contexts, "Fazi" has also been used as a cheater's nickname in some online contexts. However, given the context here, it seems acceptable.

However, for completeness and absolute clarity, the translation is correct as given, no unwanted content or spacing issue.

NO
```

```
        <source>Error: %1</source>
        <translation>Fazi : %1</translation>
    
YES
There is an unnecessary space before the colon in the translation "Fazi : %1". In Breton, the correct punctuation does not add a space before the colon in this context.

Correct translation:
Fazi: %1
```

```
        <source>Bytes:</source>
        <translation>Eizhbit:</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "Bytes:" to "Eizhbit:" is incorrect in Breton. The correct term for "bytes" in Breton is "octed" (borrowed from French 'octet') or "bited". "Eizhbit" literally means "eight bits", which is a possible explanation for the translation, but it is not idiomatic or standard in Breton software terminology.

Correct translation:
<translation>Octed :</translation>
or
<translation>Octed :</translation>
(Note: Ensure only a single space before the colon if matching Breton/French punctuation conventions.)
```

```
        <source>Copy label</source>
        <translation>Eilañ label</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The English word "label" is untranslated into Breton; "eilañ" means "to copy". If "label" is intended to be a keyword that should not be translated, this should be clarified, but typically in localization it is translated.

Correct translation:
"Eilañ skritell" (Breton for "Copy label" where "skritell" means "label" or "caption", commonly used for interface elements.)
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(label ebet)</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. In Breton, "label" should be translated, and "ebet" means "none" or "no". The word "label" is an English loanword and is not typically used in this context in Breton. The proper translation would be:

Correct translation:
(skrid ebet)

Alternatively, "etikedenn" is the Breton word for "label", so:

(etikedenn ebet)

The translation should not use the English "label".
```

```
        <source>Wallet</source>
        <translation>Doug-moneiz</translation>
    
YES
"Doug-moneiz" is not correct in Breton. The proper translation for "Wallet" in Breton is "Gwiadell" or sometimes "Boest-arc'hant" (literally 'money box'), but "Gwiadell" is most commonly used for wallet/purse.

Correct translation:
Gwiadell
```

```
        <source>Error</source>
        <translation>Fazi</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Fazi" is not correct in Breton. The correct word for "Error" in Breton is "Fazi" (which matches here), but there is a potential ambiguity: "Fazi" means "error" in Breton, but in some contexts, "Fazi" has also been used as a cheater's nickname in some online contexts. However, given the context here, it seems acceptable.

However, for completeness and absolute clarity, the translation is correct as given, no unwanted content or spacing issue.

NO
```

```
        <source> GB</source>
        <translation> Ge</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The English "GB" (Gigabytes) is a universal abbreviation for digital storage and should generally not be translated, especially not to "Ge," which does not correspond to the correct abbreviation in Breton or is not a standard abbreviation. The trailing space is otherwise retained correctly.

Correct translation:
 GB
```

```
        <source>Form</source>
        <translation>Furmskrid</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Furmskrid" is not correct for the English word "Form" in Breton ('br'). "Furmskrid" is a Bretonized form for "formular" or "formulaire," but the standard Breton term for "form" as in a document or web form is "furmskrid" or "paperenn", depending on context. However, "furmskrid" is commonly used and accepted.

If "Form" refers to a data form (e.g., a web form or paper to be filled), "Furmskrid" is appropriate and not problematic.  
If it refers to a general "form" (like shape or appearance), the correct word would be "stumm".

Assuming this is in the UI context (like a web or application form), the translation is acceptable.

There is no unwanted content, format specifier, or stray spacing.

NO
```

```
        <source>MiB</source>
        <translation>Mie</translation>
    
YES
"Mie" is not the correct translation for "MiB" (Mebibyte) in Breton. The abbreviation "MiB" is an international standard (IEC) and should be kept as is. There is no valid reason to translate the abbreviation. 

Correct translation:
<translation>MiB</translation>
```

```
        <source>Wallet</source>
        <translation>Doug-moneiz</translation>
    
YES
"Doug-moneiz" is not correct in Breton. The proper translation for "Wallet" in Breton is "Gwiadell" or sometimes "Boest-arc'hant" (literally 'money box'), but "Gwiadell" is most commonly used for wallet/purse.

Correct translation:
Gwiadell
```

```
        <source>Error</source>
        <translation>Fazi</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Fazi" is not correct in Breton. The correct word for "Error" in Breton is "Fazi" (which matches here), but there is a potential ambiguity: "Fazi" means "error" in Breton, but in some contexts, "Fazi" has also been used as a cheater's nickname in some online contexts.

```
        <source>Form</source>
        <translation>Furmskrid</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Furmskrid" is not correct for the English word "Form" in Breton ('br'). "Furmskrid" is a Bretonized form for "formular" or "formulaire," but the standard Breton term for "form" as in a document or web form is "furmskrid" or "paperenn", depending on context.

NO

UNK_LANG, not familiar with the language 'br'.
```

```
        <source>To</source>
        <translation>Da</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. In Breton ('br'), "To" (indicating direction, as in a recipient) should be translated as "Da" only if it means "to" as in "towards". However, if "To" is part of a recipient/address field (as in an email or transaction), "Da" is acceptable. Still, to avoid ambiguity, it would be better to use "D'an" (to the) or simply "Da". 

However, in this case, there are no format specifiers, spacing is fine, and "Da" is a direct equivalent for "To" as the recipient. Therefore, it's not actually problematic.

So the answer is:

NO
```

```
        <source>From</source>
        <translation>Deus</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Deus" means "God" in Breton, not "From". The correct translation for "From" in Breton is "Digant".

Correct translation:
<translation>Digant</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy label</source>
        <translation>Eilañ label</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The English word "label" is untranslated into Breton; "eilañ" means "to copy". If "label" is intended to be a keyword that should not be translated, this should be clarified, but typically in localization it is translated.

Correct translation:
"Eilañ skritell" (Breton for "Copy label" where "skritell" means "label" or "caption", commonly used for interface elements.)
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Doug-moneiz:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Doug-moneiz" is not correct for the Breton language ('br'). The correct term for "Wallet" in Breton is commonly "Logell-argant" or simply "Logell".

Correct translation:
Logell-argant:
```

        <source>(no label)</source>

YES
The translation is problematic. In Breton, "label" should be translated, and "ebet" means "none" or "no". The word "label" is an English loanword and is not typically used in this context in Breton. The proper translation would be:

Correct translation:
(skrid ebet)

"Eizhbit" literally means "eight bits", which is a possible explanation for the translation, but it is not idiomatic or standard in Breton software terminology.

YES
The translation is incorrect. "Deus" means "God" in Breton, not "From". The correct translation for "From" in Breton is "Digant".

Correct translation:
<translation>Digant</translation>

        <source>To</source>

Correct translation:
"Eilañ skritell" (Breton for "Copy label" where "skritell" means "label" or "caption", commonly used for interface elements.)

        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Ezporzhiañ roadennoù an ivinell-mañ en ur rest</translation>
    
YES
There is a spelling error and a missing letter in the word "rest" (should be "restr" for "file" in Breton). The format specifiers are fine. Otherwise, the translation is understandable, but the typo makes it problematic.

Correct translation:
Ezporzhiañ roadennoù an ivinell-mañ en ur restr
```

```
        <source>Error: Cannot extract destination from the generated scriptpubkey</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Cannot extract destination from the generated scriptpubkey</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic because the word "Error" is mistranslated as "Fazi," which is incorrect in Breton. Additionally, the remainder of the sentence is not translated and is left in English. The correct translation should render the entire sentence in Breton.

Correct translation:  
Fazi : Ne c\'hell ket echuiñ an destenn goude ar scriptpubkey savet
```

```
        <source>Error: Couldn't create cursor into database</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Couldn't create cursor into database</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic because the English part "Couldn't create cursor into database" is not translated; it remains in English within the Breton translation. Also, the word "Fazi" is not correct Breton for "Error." The correct Breton word for "Error" is "Fazi" in the original text might have been a false friend or typo; actually, in Breton, "Fazi" typically means "error" or "fault," so it is correct, but the rest must be translated.

Correct translation:  
Fazi : Ne c'helle ket krouiñ ur kurzor er baze-donneoù
```

```
        <source>Error: Disk space is low for %s</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Disk space is low for %s</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect because the English word "Error" should be translated into Breton ("Fazi" is Breton for "Error"), but the rest of the sentence remains in English, which is inconsistent and incorrect for a full translation. The entire message should be translated into Breton, preserving the format specifier %s.

Correct translation:
Fazi: N'eus ket kalz lec'h war %s
```

```
        <source>Error: Dumpfile checksum does not match. Computed %s, expected %s</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Dumpfile checksum does not match. Computed %s, expected %s</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is partially untranslated and contains English text "Dumpfile checksum does not match. Computed %s, expected %s" which should be translated into Breton. Also, "Fazi" is an incorrect form; the correct Breton word for "Error" is "Fazi" or better "Fazi" is acceptable but typically "Fazi" is a loan form. The phrase should be fully translated while keeping the format specifiers unchanged.

Correct translation:  
Fazi : ar gwerzhadigezh Dumpfile n'eo ket skoret. Computed %s, expected %s

However, fuller Breton translation for the phrase would be:  
Fazi : n’eo ket kenberc’het gwiriekad an dosier skuizh. Computed %s, expected %s

Since "computed" and "expected" are not translated, they should be Bretonized:  
Fazi : N’eo ket korreket an evezhiad dosier. Hizivet %s, gortozet %s

Therefore the best corrected translation:  
Fazi : N’eo ket korreket an evezhiad dosier. Hiziviet %s, gortozet %s
```

```
        <source>Error: Failed to create new watchonly wallet</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Failed to create new watchonly wallet</translation>
    
YES  
The translation retains the English phrase "Failed to create new watchonly wallet" untranslated, which is inconsistent. Also, the word "Fazi" should be "Fazi" or a proper translation for "Error" depending on the Breton language usage. The correct Breton translation for "Error" is "Fazi" or "Fazi" seems acceptable but the rest must be translated as well. A proper translation would be:

"Fazi: N'haller ket krouiñ ur hamden hep varc'hañ nevez"  

(if "watchonly wallet" is rendered as "hamden hep varc'hañ" literally "wallet without spending") or another precise Breton phrase for "watchonly wallet" if available, but at minimum the phrase should be fully translated to Breton instead of mixing English in.
```

```
        <source>Error: Missing checksum</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Sammad-gwiriañ o vankout</translation>
    
YES  
The translation incorrectly uses "Fazi" for "Error," which should be "Fazi" or preferably "Fazi" is often used, but in Breton the more natural term is "Fazi" or "Fazioù" for plural "Errors." However, the main issue is that "Sammad-gwiriañ o vankout" is an awkward and incorrect phrasing for "Missing checksum." "Sammad-gwiriañ" seems like a literal calque and is not a proper term in Breton for "checksum." A better translation for "checksum" in Breton is "rezistans gwiriona" or just "rezistans" (meaning resistance/check) or "kod gwiriona." "Missing" corresponds to "doanet" or "koll" (lost/missing).

A more appropriate and natural translation would be:

"Fazi : kod gwiriona doanet"

Note also the usage of a colon ":" with a space before it per Breton typographical rules, or at least a single space after colon.

Correct translation:  
Fazi : kod gwiriona doanet
```

```
        <source>Error: No %s addresses available.</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Adres %s hegerz ebet.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains an error in the first word "Fazi," which should be "Fazi" or "Faziñ" depending on context, but more importantly, the source word "Error" is commonly translated as "Fazi" or "Faziñ" in Breton. The given translation uses "Fazi" which is acceptable. However, the order and form of the sentence "Adres %s hegerz ebet." is somewhat unnatural. The word "adres" should be pluralized to match "addresses," i.e., "adresoù." Also, "hegerz ebet" literally means "no available," which is somewhat correct but would more naturally be "n'eus ket eus" or "n'o deus ket" to say "there are no %s addresses available."

A more natural and grammatically correct translation would be:

Fazi: N'eus ket adresoù %s.

or

Fazi: N'o deus ket adresoù %s dija.

But keeping close to the source, the better form is:

Fazi: N'eus ket adresoù %s.

So, the corrected translation:

Fazi: N'eus ket adresoù %s.
```

```
        <source>Error: Unable to remove watchonly address book data</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Unable to remove watchonly address book data</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is partially in English and does not translate the phrase into Breton ('br'). "Error:" is incorrectly translated as "Fazi:" which is not correct in Breton, and the remainder is left in English. The entire phrase should be translated into Breton.  

Correct translation:  
"Kuzul: Ne c'heller ket dilemel roadennoù burev diwelet hepken"
```

```
        <source>Error: Could not add watchonly tx %s to watchonly wallet</source>
        <translation>Fazi: Could not add watchonly tx %s to watchonly wallet</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic because it contains untranslated English text and does not translate the word "Error" correctly ("Fazi" seems incorrect or unrelated). The entire message should be fully translated into Breton, adhering to the source format and including the placeholder %s correctly.

Correct translation:  
"Fazi : Ne c'helle ket ouzhpennañ tx watchonly %s en ur gouskell watchonly"
```
