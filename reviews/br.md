```
        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>Kilikañ a-zehou evit cheñch an adres pe al label</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses the word "cheñch" which means "change" but in the context of a Bitcoin transaction, "change" refers to the amount of Bitcoin returned to the sender. The word "cheñch" in the translation implies editing the address or label itself, which is not the intended meaning. A more appropriate translation would be to use a word that signifies "edit" or "modify."

NO
```

```
        <source>New</source>
        <translation>Nevez</translation>
    
YES - The translation of "New" to "Nevez" is incorrect for the context of Bitcoin. "Nevez" is not a standard or recognized term in Portuguese related to Bitcoin. The correct translation for "New" in this context would be "Novo".
Novo

```
        <source>Enter address or label to search</source>
        <translation>Lakaat adres pe label da glask</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "glask" which is not a recognized word in any language. The intended meaning is likely "search".

Correct translation: Lakaat adres pe label da tsara

        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>Dilemel</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The correct translation for "Delete" in Portuguese is "Excluir" or "Deletar".

```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Choaz an adres ma 'vo resevet gwenneien diganti</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses archaic and incorrect Breton. The correct translation would be:
<translation>Dibab an_adress evit reseipt monei digant</translation>
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>Choaz</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. The correct translation of "Choose" to Portuguese (which is likely what 'br' refers to) is "Escolha".

YES
The translation is inaccurate. The correct translation of "Choose" to Portuguese is "Escolha".

        <translation>Ho adresoù Bitcoin evit kas paeamantoù int. Gwirekaat ar sammad hag an adres a resev bewezh a-raok kas gwenneien.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is not in the 'br' language. It appears to be in Breton. The correct translation into Portuguese (likely the intended 'br' language) is provided below.

NO - Ho adresoù Bitcoin evit kas paeamantoù int. Gwirekaat ar sammad hag an adres a resev bewezh a-raok kas gwenneien.

Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses Italian ("Ho adresoù Bitcoin evit resev paeamantoù eo.") instead of the specified 'br' language. The rest of the translation is in English.
Correct translation: "These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses. Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'."

YES
The provided translation uses an unknown language.
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Eilañ Label</translation>
    
YES, The translation of "Copy Label" to "Eilañ Label" is incorrect. "Eilañ" does not appear to be a valid word in Portuguese (the language often referred to by the 'br' locale code). The correct translation would be "Copiar Rótulo".

Copiar Rótulo
```

```
        <source>Edit</source>
        <translation>Cheñch</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "Cheñch" is a misspelling of the intended word "Change". The user likely meant to translate the English word "Edit" to the Portuguese word "Editar" or the Spanish word "Editar" or "Cambiar", depending on the target language. However, the provided translation is a misspelling and doesn't accurately convey the meaning of "Edit" in either language.

Correct translation:
If the context is Portuguese: "Editar"
If the context is Spanish: "Editar" or "Cambiar"
```

```
        <source>Export Address List</source>
        <translation>Ezporzhiañ Listenn an Adresoù</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of the source text. The source text "Export Address List" means to save a list of Bitcoin addresses. The provided translation appears to be in Breton and translates to "Export Address List" but uses the incorrect word for export. The correct translation for export is "Ezporzhiañ".

Correct translation: Ezporzhiañ Listenn an Adresoù

The translation is inaccurate. The phrase "(no label)" should be translated to "(sem rótulo)" in Portuguese (which 'br' likely refers to). "label ebet" does not appear to be a meaningful translation.

YES, the translation is problematic. The term "Doug-moneiz" is not a recognized or standard term in Bitcoin or any other context. It appears to be a nonsensical or invented word.

NO
```

```
        <source>Internal error</source>
        <translation>Fazi diabarzh</translation>
    
YES, The translation appears to be incorrect. "Fazi diabarzh" does not seem to be a standard or recognized translation for "Internal error" in the context of Bitcoin, or in any common language. The provided translation may be nonsensical or an error in the translation process.

NO
```

```
        <source>Error: %1</source>

```
        <source>Overview</source>
        <translation>Sell hollek</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical. The English word "Overview" translates to "Visão Geral" or "Resumo" in Portuguese. The provided translation "Sell hollek" does not correspond to any meaningful word or phrase in Portuguese and appears to be random or spam-like.

        <source>About Qt</source>

Correct translation: Carteira:

```
        <source>Receive</source>

        <translation>Restr</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "File" in the context of Bitcoin. "Restr" likely means "restricted" or "restriction," which is not related to a file in this context.
Correct translation: Ficheiro
```

```
        <source>Help</source>
        <translation>Sikour</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Help". The correct translation for "Help" in Portuguese (which 'br' likely refers to) is "Ajuda".

```
        <source>Error</source>

```
        <source>Warning</source>
        <translation>Diwall</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. The word "Diwall" does not mean "Warning" in any recognized language.
The correct translation for "Warning" in a context that might be understood by a wider audience, though not directly related to Bitcoin specifics, would be something like "Aviso" or "Atención" in Spanish, or "Attention" in French. However, if "br" is intended to be Portuguese, then "Aviso" or "Atenção" would be appropriate. Without knowing the intended target language for 'br', it's difficult to provide a definitive correction. Assuming it's Portuguese:

        <source>Wallet: %1

        <translation>Doug-moneiz: %1

The translation uses a nonsensical term "Doug-moneiz" which is not a recognized term in the context of Bitcoin or finance. It should be a direct translation of "Wallet".
Correct translation: Carteira: %1

```
        <source>Type: %1

        <translation>Seurt: %1

YES, The translation is problematic. The word "Seurt" is not a recognized word in any language. It appears to be a misspelling or an error.
The correct translation for "Type" in the context of Bitcoin would be "Tipo".

Correct translation:
Tipo: %1

```
        <source>Bytes:</source>
        <translation>Eizhbit:</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect. "Bytes" in the context of Bitcoin refers to data size and should be translated to "Bytes" or "Octetos". "Eizhbit" is not a recognized term.

Correct translation: Bytes
```

```
        <source>Amount:</source>
        <translation>Sammad:</translation>

        <source>Welcome</source>
        <translation>Donemat</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and nonsensical. The word "Donemat" is not a recognized word in any language, and it does not convey the meaning of "Welcome". The correct translation for "Welcome" in a context like this, especially in a more formal or digital setting, would be "Bem-vindo" (if addressing a male) or "Bem-vinda" (if addressing a female). If a gender-neutral greeting is preferred, "Bem-vindos" can be used to address a group. Given the context of Bitcoin, a general greeting is likely intended.

NO
```

```
        <source> GB</source>
        <translation> Ge</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect and does not reflect the intended meaning of "GB" in the context of Bitcoin, which typically refers to Gigabytes or Gigabits. The translation "Ge" does not correspond to any standard abbreviation or term.
Correct translation: GB
```

```
        <source>version</source>

NO

```
        <source>Form</source>
        <translation>Furmskrid</translation>

Correct translation: Forma
```

```
        <source>MiB</source>
        <translation>Mie</translation>
    
YES
The translation from "MiB" (Mebibytes) to "Mie" is incorrect. "MiB" is a standard unit of data storage. The correct translation into Portuguese (which 'br' likely refers to) would be "MiB" itself, or "Mebibyte" if a full word translation is preferred. However, given the context of Bitcoin and data sizes, retaining the abbreviation is common.

Mie

YES - The translation "Kaset" is incorrect and does not accurately convey the meaning of "Sent" in the context of Bitcoin network activity. The term "Kaset" in Portuguese can mean "cassette" or "tape," which is unrelated to the concept of sending data. A more appropriate translation would be "Enviado" or "Enviados" depending on whether it's referring to a singular or plural amount.

YES
The translation "Seurt" is not a recognized word in any language, and does not accurately translate "Type". In the context of Bitcoin peers, "Type" refers to the kind of connection. The correct translation should be "Tipo" which means "Type" in Portuguese.
NO
```

        <extracomment>Title of Peers Table column which states the network the peer connected through.</extracomment>
        <translation>Rouedad</translation>
    
YES. The translation of "Network" to "Rouedad" is incorrect and does not fit the context of Bitcoin networks. "Rouedad" means "roughening" or "cragginess" in Portuguese. The correct translation for "Network" in this context should be "Red".

NO.
```

```
        <source>Network</source>
        <translation>Rouedad</translation>
    
YES, the translation is incorrect. The word "Rouedad" does not mean "Network" in Portuguese. The correct translation for "Network" in the context of Bitcoin would be "Rede".

NO
```

```
        <source>Wallet: </source>
        <translation>Doug-moneiz: </translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic as "Doug-moneiz" is not a valid or recognized term in the context of Bitcoin or any other language. It appears to be nonsensical or possibly a playful, incorrect substitution. The correct translation for "Wallet" in this context, if a direct translation is desired, would be "Carteira" (Portuguese). However, given the context of Bitcoin and the common usage in English, keeping "Wallet" might also be acceptable if the target audience is familiar with English Bitcoin terminology. Assuming a direct translation is intended:

Doug-moneiz: Wallet
```

```
        <source>Sent</source>
        <translation>Kaset</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Kaset" means "cassette" in Indonesian and is not related to Bitcoin. The correct translation for "Sent" in Indonesian would be "Dikirim".
Dikirim
```

```
        <source>No</source>
        <translation>Ket</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Ket" for "No" is incorrect and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The correct translation for "No" in Malay (assuming 'br' is a typo and meant Malay or Indonesian, as 'br' is not a standard ISO language code) is "Tidak" or "Bukan".

However, since the provided language code is 'br', and I am unfamiliar with it, I will proceed with that assumption.

UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>To</source>
        <translation>Da</translation>

        <translation>Fazi: Sammad-gwiriañ o vankout</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses "Fazi" which seems like a misspelling of "Fazit" (conclusion/summary in German) or an unrelated word, rather than an appropriate translation for "Error" in Breton. The Breton word for "Error" is "Fazi" or "Error".

The correct translation for "Error: Missing checksum" in Breton is:
Fazi: Sammad-gwiriañ o vankout
