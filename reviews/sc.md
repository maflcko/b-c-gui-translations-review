        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Scebera a cali incarreramentu bolis mandai is monedas</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The phrase "Scebera a cali incarreramentu bolis mandai is monedas" is not standard in Sardinian ('sc'). "Scebera a cali incarreramentu" is a literal and awkward construction for "Choose the address"—"incarreramentu" is not a recognized term for "address" in Sardinian, and the structure as a whole is unclear. Also, "bolis mandai" is a literal rendering and ungrammatical.

Correct translation:
Scebera s'indiritzu a su quali imbiare is monedas

Explanation: 
- "Scebera" = "Choose"
- "s'indiritzu" = "the address"
- "a su quali" = "to which"
- "imbiare" = "to send"
- "is monedas" = "the coins"
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Sciobera s'incarreramentu po arrici is monedas cun</translation>
    
YES
The translation has inaccuracies and is problematic. Specifically, "S'incarreramentu" is not an accurate translation of "address" in this context. The wording and grammar are also awkward; "arrici" is not standard for "to receive" ("arriòiri" or "arrèciri" would be more correct, depending on the Sardinian variant). "Po arrici is monedas cun" is not idiomatic Sardinian.

Correct translation:
Scegi s'indiritzu cun su cale recìvere is monedas

This uses "indiritzu" (the Sardinian word for "address") and "recìvere" (to receive), keeping the meaning intact and the grammar correct.
