```
        <source>Create a new address</source>
        <translation>Crea un'incarreramentu nou</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of Bitcoin addresses. The word "incarreramentu" is not a recognized term for an address in Sardinian.

Correct translation: Crea un indirizzu novu
```

```
        <source>Enter address or label to search</source>
        <translation>Poni s'incarreramentu o s'etiketa po circai</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning. The phrase "Poni s'incarreramentu o s'etiketa po circai" does not translate to "Enter address or label to search" in a way that is understandable in the context of Bitcoin.

Correct translation: Introduci s'indiritzu o s'eticheta po circai
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Scebera a cali incarreramentu bolis mandai is monedas</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning. The source text is asking the user to select an address to send coins to, which is a common operation in Bitcoin transactions. The provided translation appears to be in Sardinian, but it's nonsensical and doesn't relate to the context of sending cryptocurrency.

Correct translation: "Scebera s'indiritzu a chi bolis ispedire is arretzas"
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Sciobera s'incarreramentu po arrici is monedas cun</translation>
    
YES, The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning. The word "Sciobera" is not a recognized word in any language, and the rest of the sentence is a jumble of words that do not form a coherent thought.

Correct translation: Sceber s'incarreramentu po arriciu is monedasa cun
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>Sciobera</translation>
    
YES
The provided translation is incorrect. "Sciobera" is not a valid word in any known language and does not translate to "Choose".

NO

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Custus funt is incarreramentu Bitcoin tuus po mandai pagamentus. Càstia sempri sa cantidadi e s'incarreramentu destinatàriu antis de inviais is monedas</translation>
    
YES
The translation appears to be in Sardinian. While the translation captures the general meaning of the source text, the phrasing and vocabulary used are not entirely idiomatic for a Bitcoin context. Specifically, "Custus funt is incarreramentu Bitcoin tuus po mandai pagamentus" is a literal translation that sounds awkward. A more natural phrasing would be closer to "Custus est s'indiritzu Bitcoin tuu po mandare pagamentos." Similarly, "Càstia sempri sa cantidadi e s'incarreramentu destinatàriu antis de inviais is monedas" could be improved for naturalness.

A more contextually appropriate and fluent translation in Sardinian would be:

<translation>Custu est s'indiritzu Bitcoin tuu pro mandare pagamentos. Controlla semper sa cantidade e s'indiritzu de destinatariu in antis de mandare sas monedas.</translation>
