```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Escolle a dirección da que recibir moedas</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Escolle a dirección da que recibir moedas" translates back as "Choose the address from which to receive coins," which changes the intended meaning. The source wants the user to choose the address with which (to) receive coins, not from which coins are received. This distinction matters for clarity.

Correct translation:
Escolle a dirección coa que recibir moedas
```

```
        <source>change from %1 (%2)</source>
        <translation>Cambia de %1 a (%2)</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. The English phrase refers to "change" in the context of Bitcoin transactions, meaning the return amount, not the verb "change." The correct translation should convey the concept of "change" (o troco) from a transaction, not "cambiar."

Correct translation:
Troco de %1 (%2)
```

```
        <source>Reset Options</source>
        <translation>Opcións de Restaurar</translation>
    
YES
The translation does not accurately reflect the source. "Opcións de Restaurar" means "Restore Options," but the intended meaning is to "reset" the settings/options, i.e., to put them back to defaults. The correct Galician translation would be "Restablecer opcións".

Correct translation:
Restablecer opcións
```

```
        <source>Send Coins</source>
        <translation>Moedas Enviadas</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Moedas Enviadas" means "Coins Sent", which is the past participle form, whereas the English "Send Coins" is an imperative (command/invitation to send coins). The correct translation for "Send Coins" in Galician should use the imperative form.

Correct translation:
Enviar moedas
```

```
        <source>Click "Sign Message" to generate signature</source>
        <translation>Click en "Asinar Mensaxe" para xerar sinatura</translation>
    
YES
The word "Click" is not translated into Galician; it should be "Fai clic" or "Preme".

Correct translation:
Fai clic en "Asinar Mensaxe" para xerar a sinatura
```

```
        <source>Send Coins</source>
        <translation>Moedas Enviadas</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Moedas Enviadas" means "Coins Sent", which is the past participle form, whereas the English "Send Coins" is an imperative (command/invitation to send coins). The correct translation for "Send Coins" in Galician should use the imperative form.

Correct translation:
Enviar moedas
```
