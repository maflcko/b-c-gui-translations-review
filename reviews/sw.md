```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Nakili  Chapa</translation>
    
YES - The translation "Nakili Chapa" is incorrect. "Chapa" means "stamp" or "badge," not "label." The correct translation for "label" in this context is "lebo."

Correct translation: Nakili Lebo
```

```
        <source>Edit</source>
        <translation> hariri</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The translation of "Edit" to " hariri" is incorrect. In Swahili, "Edit" is translated to "Hariri". There is a leading space in the translation.

NO
```

```
        <source>Encrypt wallet</source>
        <translation>Simba mkoba</translation>
    
YES, The translation "Simba mkoba" is incorrect. "Simba" means "lion" in Swahili, and the intended meaning of "Encrypt wallet" is to secure the wallet. A more appropriate translation would be "Ficha mkoba".

Here's the corrected translation:
Ficha mkoba
```

```
        <source>Change passphrase</source>
        <translation>Badilisha nenosiri </translation>
    
YES, The translation has an extra non-breaking space at the end of the word "nenosiri".
The correct translation is: Badilisha nenosiri
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Wallet itasimbwa kwa njia fiche</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it uses a verb form that is not appropriate for the context. In Swahili, the correct verb form for "to be encrypted" in this context would be "ya kufichwa" or "inayofichwa".

Wallet itasimbwa kwa njia fiche is grammatically incorrect and sounds unnatural in Swahili.

Correct translation: Wallet ya kufichwa
```

```
        <source>IMPORTANT: Any previous backups you have made of your wallet file should be replaced with the newly generated, encrypted wallet file. For security reasons, previous backups of the unencrypted wallet file will become useless as soon as you start using the new, encrypted wallet.</source>
        <translation>MUHIMU: Chelezo zozote ulizofanya hapo awali za faili lako la pochi zinapaswa kubadilishwa na faili mpya ya pochi iliyosimbwa. Kwa sababu za usalama, chelezo za awali za faili la pochi lisilosimbwa zitakuwa hazifai mara tu utakapoanza kutumia pochi mpya iliyosimbwa.
 </translation>
    
YES: The translation has an extra space at the end of the sentence, which is not present in the source text. Also, "chelezo" is a direct translation of "backup" and doesn't quite fit the context of software backups. A better word would be "nakala rudufu".

NO: MUHIMU: Nakala rudufu zozote ulizofanya hapo awali za faili lako la pochi zinapaswa kubadilishwa na faili mpya ya pochi iliyosimbwa. Kwa sababu za usalama, nakala rudufu za awali za faili la pochi lisilosimbwa zitakuwa hazifai mara tu utakapoanza kutumia pochi mpya iliyosimbwa.
```

```
        <source>The supplied passphrases do not match.</source>
        <translation>Nenosiri liliyotolewa haifanani.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The source text means that the entered passphrases do not match. The provided translation means "The supplied effort does not match.". The correct translation should be "Nenosiri uliyetoa haifanani."
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>Nenosiri liliyoingizwa kwa ajili ya kufungua pochi sio sahihi.</translation>
    
YES, The translation contains an error. "Nenosiri liliyoingizwa" translates to "The password entered", but the source text states "passphrase". The correct translation should use the word for passphrase.
Nenosiri la kupitisha lililoingizwa kwa ajili ya kufungua pochi sio sahihi.
```

```
        <source>Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.</source>
        <translation>Nenosiri la pochi limefanikiwa kubadilishwa.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The word "Nenosiri" means "password" in Swahili, while the source text mentions "Wallet passphrase". The word "passphrase" is a stronger form of password, and is generally considered more secure. In this context, "passphrase" should be translated as "nenosiri la kupita" or "nenosiri maalumu" in Swahili.

The correct translation should be:
Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.
Nenosiri la kupita la pochi limefanikiwa kubadilishwa.
```

```
        <source>Settings file %1 might be corrupt or invalid.</source>
        <translation>Faili ya mipangilio ya asilimia %1 inaweza kuwa mbovu au batili.</translation>
    
YES, The word "asilimia" means "percent" in English, which is incorrect in this context. The correct translation should be "faili" for "file."
The correct translation is: Faili ya mipangilio %1 inaweza kuwa mbovu au batili.
```

```
        <source>Runaway exception</source>
        <translation>Ubaguzi wa kukimbia</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "ubaguzi" means "discrimination" or "segregation", which is not the intended meaning of "runaway exception". The intended meaning is likely an exception that occurs unexpectedly or uncontrollably. A more appropriate translation would be "Kosa la dharura".

NO
```

```
        <source>Proxy is &lt;b&gt;enabled&lt;/b&gt;: %1</source>
        <translation>Proxy &lt;b&gt;imeamilishwa&lt;/b&gt;: %1</translation>
    
YES, the translation of "enabled" to "imeamilishwa" is incorrect. "Imeamilishwa" means "has been sent" or "has been mailed". The correct translation for "enabled" in this context would be "imewezeshwa".

YES, Proxy imewezeshwa: %1
```

```
        <source>Encrypt Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Simba Mkoba...</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "Simba" means "lion" in Swahili and is not a suitable word for encrypting a Bitcoin wallet.
The correct translation should be "Ficha Mkoba..." or "Linda Mkoba..." which means "Hide Wallet..." or "Protect Wallet...".

NO
```

```
        <source>Command-line options</source>
        <translation>Chaguo za amri ya amri</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and contains a word that is likely a mistranslation of "options" or "settings". The phrase "chaguo za amri ya amri" literally translates to "choices of command of command" which is nonsensical.

A more accurate translation would be:

Chaguo za mstari wa amri
```

```
        <source>Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction</source>
        <translation>Pakia Muamala wa Bitcoin Uliosainiwa Kiasi</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The phrase "Uliosainiwa Kiasi" translates to "signed amount" which is not the intended meaning. It should be "partially signed" or "signed in part".

NO
```

```
        <source>Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction from clipboard</source>
        <translation>Pakia Muamala wa Bitcoin Uliosainiwa Kiasi kutoka kwenye ubao wa kunakili</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "Pakia" means "pack" or "load" but it is not commonly used in this context for "loading" a transaction. The phrase "Muamala wa Bitcoin Uliosainiwa Kiasi" translates to "Signed Bitcoin Transaction Amount", which is also not accurate. The correct translation should focus on loading a partially signed Bitcoin transaction.

Correct translation: Pakia Muamala wa Bitcoin Uliosainiwa Nusu kutoka kwenye ubao wa kunakili
```

```
        <source>Load Wallet Backup</source>
        <extracomment>The title for Restore Wallet File Windows</extracomment>
        <translation>Pakia Hifadhi Nakala ya Wallet</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The word "Pakia" means "Upload" or "Load" which is a verb, not a noun, and the sentence structure is incorrect for the meaning "Load Wallet Backup". The word "Hifadhi Nakala" means "Backup" which is a noun and it is used correctly. The word "Wallet" is also a noun and it is used correctly. The word "ya" is a possessive pronoun which is also used correctly.
The corrected translation should be: "Pakia Hifadhi Nakala ya Wallet". The word "Pakia" should be "Load" or "Upload" and should be used as a verb. In Swahili, "Load Wallet Backup" should be translated as "Pakia Hifadhi Nakala ya Wallet". The word "Pakia" is a verb in Swahili which means "Upload" or "Load".
"Pakia Hifadhi Nakala ya Wallet" is "Load Wallet Backup" in English.
Load Wallet Backup -> Pakia Hifadhi Nakala ya Wallet
```

```
        <source>Hide</source>
        <translation>Ficha</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. "Hide" in the context of Bitcoin would likely mean to conceal or make something not visible. "Ficha" in Swahili means "token" or "chip". A more appropriate translation for "Hide" in this context would be "Ficha" (in the sense of hiding/concealing) or "Ficha" (to hide).

The correct translation is:
<translation>Ficha</translation>
```

```
        <source>Show</source>
        <translation>Jinsi  jinsi</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "Jinsi" means "how" in Swahili, and repeating it does not make sense in this context. The English word "Show" is a command. A better translation would be "Onyesha" which means "Show" in Swahili.

NO
```

```
        <source>Wallet: %1
</source>
        <translation>Pochi: %1
</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. "Pochi" is not a Swahili word for wallet. The correct translation for "wallet" is "mkoba" or "mfuko".
Pochi: %1
mkoba: %1
```

```
        <source>HD key generation is &lt;b&gt;enabled&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>Uzalishaji wa ufunguo wa HD ni &lt;b&gt;kuwezeshwa &lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The Swahili word "kuwezeshwa" means "to be enabled" which is grammatically incorrect in this context. The correct word should be "imeanzishwa" or "imeongezwa" depending on the context.

Here is the correct translation: Uzalishaji wa ufunguo wa HD ni &lt;b&gt;imeanzishwa&lt;/b&gt;
```

```
        <source>HD key generation is &lt;b&gt;disabled&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>Uzalishaji wa ufunguo wa HD ni &lt;b&gt;kutowezeshwa&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "kutowezeshwa" which means "disabled" or "unauthorized" is not the correct term to use in this context. The correct word would be "imezimwa" which means "turned off" or "disabled".

NO, Uzalishaji wa ufunguo wa HD umewezeshwa &lt;b&gt;imezimwa&lt;/b&gt;
```

```
        <source>Wallet is &lt;b&gt;encrypted&lt;/b&gt; and currently &lt;b&gt;unlocked&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>Wallet &lt;b&gt;imesimbwa kwa njia fiche&lt;/b&gt; na &lt;b&gt;imefunguliwa&lt;/b&gt; kwa sasa</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "imesimbwa kwa njia fiche" is an incorrect translation of "encrypted." The correct translation in Swahili for "encrypted" in this context would be "imefichwa kwa njia fiche" or simply "imefichwa."

NO
```

```
        <source>Wallet is &lt;b&gt;encrypted&lt;/b&gt; and currently &lt;b&gt;locked&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>Pochi &lt;b&gt;imesimbwa kwa njia fiche&lt;/b&gt; na &lt;b&gt;imefungwa&lt;/b&gt;kwa sasa</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it uses the wrong word for "Wallet". It uses "Pochi" which means purse or wallet for carrying items, not a digital wallet for cryptocurrency.
Pochi <b > imesimbwa kwa njia fiche </b> na <b > imefungwa </b> kwa sasa
```

```
        <source>Fee:</source>
        <translation>Ada:</translation>
    
YES, Ada is not the correct translation for Fee. The correct translation for Fee in Swahili is Malipo or Ghara.
NO
```

```
        <source>Change:</source>
        <translation>Badilisha:</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. In the context of Bitcoin transactions, "Change" refers to the remaining amount of Bitcoin returned to the sender. The Swahili word "Badilisha" means "change" in the sense of alteration or modification, not in the sense of a monetary remainder. A more appropriate translation would be "Kitufe" or "Ziada".

NO
```

```
        <source>Lock unspent</source>
        <translation>Funga ambayo haijatumika</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "Funga" in Swahili can mean "close" or "lock", but in this context, it does not accurately convey the meaning of "lock unspent" in relation to Bitcoin. The phrase "ambayo haijatumika" translates to "which has not been used", which is a good translation of "unspent". However, the combination of "Funga ambayo haijatumika" sounds unnatural and doesn't clearly communicate the intended Bitcoin transaction concept.

A more appropriate translation would be:

<translation>Funga fedha ambazo hazijatumika</translation>
```

```
        <source>(change)</source>
        <translation>(badilisha)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "badilisha" in Swahili means "change" in the sense of to alter, to convert, or to exchange. In the context of Bitcoin, the word "change" refers to the leftover amount of Bitcoin that is returned to the sender after a transaction. The correct Swahili word for this is "mabadiliko".

(mabadiliko)
```

```
        <source>Load Wallets</source>
        <extracomment>Title of progress window which is displayed when wallets are being loaded.</extracomment>
        <translation>Pakia Pochi</translation>
    
YES - The translation "Pakia Pochi" means "Pack Purses" which is not accurate for "Load Wallets". The correct translation should be "Pakia Mifuko" or "Pakia Milango".
NO - Pakia Mifuko
```

```
        <source>Wallet</source>
        <translation>Pochi</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. 'Pochi' means 'few' in Italian, not 'Wallet' in Swahili. The correct Swahili word for wallet is 'mkoba'.
NO
```

```
        <source>Encrypt the wallet. The wallet will be encrypted with a passphrase of your choice.</source>
        <translation>Simba pochi. Pochi itasimbwa kwa kutumia nenosiri utakalo chagua.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. "Simba pochi" means "Lion wallet", which is not the intended meaning of "Encrypt the wallet". The correct translation should be "Ficha pochi".

NO - The translation is unproblematic.
```

```
        <source>Make a blank wallet. Blank wallets do not initially have private keys or scripts. Private keys and addresses can be imported, or an HD seed can be set, at a later time.</source>
        <translation>Tengeneza pochi tupu. Pochi tupu kwa kuanza hazina funguo za siri au hati. Funguo za siri zinaweza kuingizwa, au mbegu ya HD inaweza kuwekwa baadae.</translation>
    
YES, The word "funguo" is translated to "keys" instead of "private keys". The word "hati" is translated to "scripts" instead of "private keys". The corrected translation is "Fanya pochi tupu. Pochi tupu hazina funguo za siri au script kwa kuanza. Funguo za siri au script zinaweza kuagizwa, au mbegu ya HD inaweza kuwekwa baadaye."
```

```
        <source>Error</source>
        <translation>Onyo</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The English word "Error" directly translates to "Hitilafu" or "Kosa" in Swahili. "Onyo" means "Warning" or "Notice", which is not an accurate translation for "Error".

The correct translation for "Error" is "Hitilafu".

NO
```

```
        <source>Error</source>
        <translation>Onyo</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The English word "Error" directly translates to "Hitilafu" or "Kosa" in Swahili. "Onyo" means "Warning" or "Notice", which is not an accurate translation for "Error".

The correct translation for "Error" is "Hitilafu".

NO
```

```
        <source>Fee:</source>
        <translation>Ada:</translation>
    
YES, Ada is not the correct translation for Fee. The correct translation for Fee in Swahili is Malipo or Ghara.
NO
```

```
        <source>Change:</source>
        <translation>Badilisha:</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. In the context of Bitcoin transactions, "Change" refers to the remaining amount of Bitcoin returned to the sender. The Swahili word "Badilisha" means "change" in the sense of alteration or modification, not in the sense of a monetary remainder. A more appropriate translation would be "Kitufe" or "Ziada".

NO
```

```
        <source>Error</source>
        <translation>Onyo</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The English word "Error" directly translates to "Hitilafu" or "Kosa" in Swahili. "Onyo" means "Warning" or "Notice", which is not an accurate translation for "Error".

The correct translation for "Error" is "Hitilafu".

NO

```
        <source>More than one onion bind address is provided. Using %s for the automatically created Tor onion service.</source>
        <translation>Zaidi ya anuani moja ya onion bind imetolewa. Inatumia %skwa ajili ya huduma ya Tor onion inayotengeneza kiotomatiki. </translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because of an incorrect word choice and a formatting error. The word "anuani" means address, but in the context of Bitcoin, the correct term for a Bitcoin address is "anwani" without the letter "u". Additionally, there is a missing space between "%s" and "kwa" in the translation, which should be "%s kwa".

More than one onion bind address is provided. Using %s for the automatically created Tor onion service.
Zaidi ya anwani moja ya onion bind imetolewa. Inatumia %s kwa ajili ya huduma ya Tor onion inayotengeneza kiotomatiki.

        <source>Invalid -i2psam address or hostname: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Anuani ya -i2psam au jina la mwenyeji ni batili: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation is problematic as "Anuani" is not a valid Swahili word. The correct word for "address" in Swahili is "Anwani".

Anwani ya -i2psam au jina la mwenyeji ni batili: '%s'
```

```
        <source>Invalid -onion address or hostname: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Anuani ya onion au jina la mwenyeji ni batili: '%s'</translation>
    
YES - The translation for "Invalid" is incorrect. The correct Swahili word for invalid is "batili". The translation should be: "Anwani ya onion au jina la mwenyeji ni batili: '%s'".
```

```
        <source>Invalid -proxy address or hostname: '%s'</source>
        <translation>Anuani ya wakala au jina la mwenyeji ni batili: '%s'</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the word "Anuani" means "address" in Swahili, which is incorrect in this context. The correct word should be "Anwani" which means "address" as well but in a different context. The word "wakala" means "agent" or "proxy" in Swahili, which is also incorrect. The correct word should be "proksi" which means "proxy".

Anwani ya proksi au jina la mwenyeji ni batili: '%s'
