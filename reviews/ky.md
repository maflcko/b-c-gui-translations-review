        <translation>Даректи алмашуу буферинен коюу</translation>
    
YES
There is a typo in the translation: "Даректи" should be "Даректини" to match the accusative case required by the verb "коюу" (to paste).

Correct translation:
Даректини алмашуу буферинен коюу
```

        <source>default</source>
        <translation>жарыяланбаган</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "default" as "жарыяланбаган" is incorrect. "Жарыяланбаган" means "unpublished" in Kyrgyz, which is not the intended meaning of "default" (i.e., the preset or standard option).

Correct translation:
демейки
