        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Escueye la dirección a la que mandar los coins</translation>
    
YES  
The word "coins" should be translated into Asturian rather than left in English, as it is not a technical term that must remain untranslated. A more appropriate translation would use "monedes" (the Asturian word for coins). Also, "Escueye" is correct, but "dirreición" is the usual Asturian spelling instead of the Spanish "dirección".

Correct translation:  
Escueye la dirreición a la que mandar les monedes
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Escueye la dirección pa recibir los coins</translation>
    
YES  
The mix of Spanish and English is inconsistent. "coins" should be translated into Asturian (or Spanish if not available) to maintain consistency. The rest is acceptable, except "pa" should be "pa'" as a contraction of "para" in Asturian, or better expanded to "para". Also, in Asturian, "escueye" is correct but "escueye la dirección para recibir les monedes" is better. "coins" should be translated as "monedes" (coins in Asturian).

Correct translation:  
Escueye la dirección pa recibir les monedes
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>Escoyer</translation>
    
YES  
The word "Escoyer" is incorrect in asturian (ast_ES). The correct translation for "Choose" is "Escoyer" is a misspelling or nonstandard. The correct form is "Escoyer" is not recognized; the proper translation is "Escoyer" is a mistake, the correct translation is:

Correct translation:  
Escoyer --> Escoyer is wrong. Instead, use "Escoyer" (no). The correct verb is "Escoyer" or more commonly "Escoyer" is not correct. The correct asturian verb for "choose" is "Escoyer" does not exist.

In Asturian language, the verb "escolle" means "choose" (imperative form "escolle"), or the infinitive "escojer" (to choose).

Thus, the correct translation is:

Escoger --> Escoyer is not correct.

Correct translation:  
Escoyer -> "Escoyer" should be replaced with "Escoyer" does not exist, so "Escoyer" is wrong.

The correct imperative in Asturian is "Escoyer" no, in fact the infinitive is "escoxer", similar to Spanish "escoger".

The imperative form is "escoxe".

So:

"Choose" --> "Escoyer" (incorrect)  
Correct translation: "Escoxe"

Final answer:

YES  
The translation "Escoyer" is incorrect in Asturian. The correct translation for "Choose" is "Escoxe".

```
        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Advertencia: Si cifras la tua cartera y pierdes la frase de seguridá, ¡perderás &lt;b&gt;TOOS LOS TUYOS BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>
    
YES
There are several issues in the translation:
- "tuia" should be "tuya".
- "frase de seguridá" is understandable but the standard Asturian term would be "frase de seguridá" or "contraseña". "Frase de seguridá" is acceptable.
- "toos los tuyos bitcoins" is a literal and incorrect translation. It mixes Spanish and Asturian incorrectly ("toos" is Asturian for "todos", but "tuyos bitcoins" is not natural). Better to say "¡perderás &lt;b&gt;TOOS LOS TOS BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!" or "¡perderás &lt;b&gt;TOOS LOS TUYOS BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!" is a mixture but awkward.
- The phrase should be clear and idiomatic in Asturian:
Correct translation:
"Advertencia: Si cifras la to cartera y pierdes la frase de seguridá, ¡perderás &lt;b&gt;TOOS LOS TOYOS BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!"

Alternatively, since "Bitcoin" is a proper noun, it can stay as in the source.

Final corrected translation:
"Advertencia: Si cifras la to cartera y pierdes la frase de seguridá, ¡perderás &lt;b&gt;TOOS LOS TOYOS BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!"

Also "frase de seguridá" is fine in context.

Additionally, spacing is correct.

Therefore, the corrected translation should be:

<translation>Advertencia: Si cifras la to cartera y pierdes la frase de seguridá, ¡perderás &lt;b&gt;TOOS LOS TOYOS BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>
```

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?</source>
        <translation>¿Estás seguru de que quieres cifrar la tua cartera?</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains errors in spelling and language consistency. "seguru" should be "seguro" (correct Spanish spelling), and "tua" should be "tu" for standard Spanish instead of a regional variant or incorrect form.

Correct translation:
¿Estás seguro de que quieres cifrar tu cartera?
```

```
        <source>Remember that encrypting your wallet cannot fully protect your bitcoins from being stolen by malware infecting your computer.</source>
        <translation>Recuerda que cifrar la tua cartera nun puede protexer completamente los tuyos bitcoins de ser robados por malware que infecte tu ordenador.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains errors in possessive adjectives and word order. "tua" should be "tu" (informal second person singular possessive in Asturian), and "los tuyos bitcoins" should be "tus bitcoins." Also, word order and article usage need minor adjustment for naturalness.

Correct translation:  
Recuerda que cifrar tu cartera nun puede protexer completamente tus bitcoins de ser robados por malware que infecte tu ordenador.
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>La tua cartera ta a punto de ser cifrada.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes Spanish and a non-Asturian word ("tua" instead of "túa"). In Asturian, the correct possessive adjective is "la to" (feminine singular for "your"), not "la tua" which seems influenced by Spanish. Also, "cartera" is fine, but "ta a punto de ser cifrada" is acceptable in Spanish, while Asturian typically uses "está a punto de ser cifrada" or better yet "ta a punto de ser cifrada" could be dialectal but the possessive is definitely not correct. Proper Asturian translation would be:

"La to cartera ta a punto de ser cifrada."

Alternatively, if aiming for more natural Asturian:

"La to carteira ta a punto de ser cifrada."

Note that "carteira" is more Asturian than Spanish "cartera."

Correct translation:  
"La to carteira ta a punto de ser cifrada."
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is now encrypted. </source>
        <translation>La tua cartera ta cifrada agora.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes languages: "La tua cartera ta cifrada agora." combines Italian ("tua") and Asturian ("ta", "cartera", "agora"). The correct Asturian translation should use "Tu" instead of "tua", and "está" or "ta" can be used for "is". A better translation is:

"Tu cartera ta cifrada agora."
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Falló el cifrado de la cartera debido a un error internu. La tua cartera nun fue cifrada.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes Asturian ("internu", "nun") and Spanish ("tu­a", "fue"), which is inconsistent. Also, "tu­a" should be "tua" without an accent in Asturian. "Cartera" is acceptable, but "wallet" is often translated as "billetera" or "cartera" in Spanish; in Asturian, "cartera" is correct. The phrase should be fully in Asturian:

Correct translation:  
Falló el cifráu de la cartera debido a un error internu. La to cartera nun foi cifrada.
```

```
        <source>Transactions</source>
        <translation>Tratos</translation>
    
YES  
The translation of "Transactions" as "Tratos" is incorrect in the given context. "Tratos" in Spanish generally means "deals" or "agreements" and is not appropriate for Bitcoin or financial transactions. The correct asturian translation for "Transactions" in the Bitcoin context should be "Trámites" or more commonly "Transacciones." Since the language is Asturian (ast_ES), the correct term typically used is "Transacciones."

Correct translation:  
<translation>Transacciones</translation>
```

```
        <source>Receive</source>
        <translation>Enviar</translation>
    
YES  
The English source "Receive" means to get or accept something, typically Bitcoin in this context, while the translation "Enviar" means "Send" in Spanish, which is the opposite action. The correct translation in Asturian (ast_ES) for "Receive" should be "Recibir".

Correct translation:  
<translation>Recibir</translation>
```

```
        <source>Close All Wallets…</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar toles carteres…</translation>
    
YES
There is a spelling error in the translation: "Cerrrar" should be "Cerrrar" with only two 'r's as "Cerrar".

Correct translation:
Cerrar toles carteres…
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar cartera</translation>
    
YES  
There is a typo in the translation: "Cerrrar" should be "Cerrar" with only two 'r's.

Correct translation:  
Cerrar cartera
```

```
        <source>Close all wallets</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar toles carteres</translation>
    
YES  
There is a spelling error in the translation. "Cerrrar" has an extra "r". The correct translation should be:  
"Cerrar toles carteres"
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar cartera</translation>
    
YES  
There is a typo in the translation: "Cerrrar" should be "Cerrar" with only two 'r's.

Correct translation:  
Cerrar cartera
```

```
        <source>Close all wallets</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar toles carteres</translation>
    
YES  
There is a spelling error in the translation. "Cerrrar" has an extra "r". The correct translation should be:  
"Cerrar toles carteres"
```
