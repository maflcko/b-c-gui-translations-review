```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Escueye la dirección a la que mandar los coins</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses "mandar los coins", which is problematic for two reasons:
1. "Mandar" is less formal and less standard than "enviar" in this context.
2. "los coins" mixes English ("coins") with Spanish (Asturian) grammar, which is inappropriate; "coins" should be translated.

Correct translation:
Escueye la dirección a la que enviar les monedes
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Escueye la dirección pa recibir los coins</translation>
    
YES
The translation is mostly accurate but has two issues:
1. "los coins" mixes Spanish ("los") with English ("coins"). The Asturian term for "coins" is "monedes" or "monedes" can be used. Using "coins" is inappropriate.
2. The format is otherwise fine and no whitespace issues detected.

Correct translation:
Escueye la direición pa recibir les monedes
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>La tua cartera ta a punto de ser cifrada.</translation>
    
YES
The translation "La tua cartera ta a punto de ser cifrada." is problematic for several reasons:
- "tua" is not correct for Asturian (should be "toa" or "la to").
- "ta" should be "ta" in Asturian, but combined with "a punto de", it would be better to say "ta a puntu de ser cifrada."
- The possessive phrase should be "La to cartera" in Asturian.

Correct translation:
La to cartera ta a puntu de ser cifrada.
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is now encrypted. </source>
        <translation>La tua cartera ta cifrada agora.</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses "tua", which is Italian ("your"), and "cartera" for "wallet" (should be "billetera" or "cartera" is valid in some contexts, but "tua" is definitely not Asturian). The correct Asturian translation should use "toa" (your) and maintain proper Asturian grammar. Additionally, "ta cifrada" is accurate for "is encrypted", and "agora" for "now" is correct Asturian.

Correct translation:
La to cartera ta cifrada agora.
```

```
        <source>Transactions</source>
        <translation>Tratos</translation>
    
YES
While "Tratos" is a word in Asturian, it more commonly means "deals" or "agreements", and is not the appropriate translation for financial "transactions" in the context of Bitcoin. The correct Asturian translation of "Transactions" in this financial context is "Transacciones".

Correct translation:
Transacciones
```

```
        <source>Receive</source>
        <translation>Enviar</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Receive" means to accept or get something, while "Enviar" means "Send" in Asturian (and Spanish). The correct Asturian translation should be "Recibir".

Correct translation:
Recibir
```

```
        <source>Close All Wallets…</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar toles carteres…</translation>
    
YES
There is a typo in the translation: "Cerrrar" has an extra 'r'. The correct form is "Zarrar" (Asturian for "Close"). Additionally, "toles" is a correct form for "all" (feminine plural), "carteres" is acceptable as "wallets", and the ellipsis is correctly used.

Correct translation:
Zarrar toles carteres…
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar cartera</translation>
    
YES
There is a typo in the translation: "Cerrrar" has an extra "r". It should be "Cerrar cartera".

Correct translation:
Cerrar cartera
```

```
        <source>Close all wallets</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar toles carteres</translation>
    
YES
There is a typo in the translation: "Cerrrar" has an extra 'r', it should be "Cerrar". The rest is correct.

Correct translation:
Cerrar toles carteres
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar cartera</translation>
    
YES
There is a typo in the translation: "Cerrrar" has an extra "r". It should be "Cerrar cartera".

Correct translation:
Cerrar cartera
```

```
        <source>Close all wallets</source>
        <translation>Cerrrar toles carteres</translation>
    
YES
There is a typo in the translation: "Cerrrar" has an extra 'r', it should be "Cerrar". The rest is correct.

Correct translation:
Cerrar toles carteres
```
