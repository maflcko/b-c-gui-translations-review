# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>New</source>
        <translation>Nutaamik sanagit</translation>
    
YES. The source text is "New", which is an adjective. The translation "Nutaamik sanagit" is a command that means "Create/make a new one". While this might fit the context of a button that creates a new item, it is an expansion of the source text and not a direct translation. A more accurate and versatile translation is the adjective for "new".

Correct translation:
Nutaaq
```

```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>Allattorsimaffimminngaanniit toqqakkat peeruk</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses the plural form "toqqakkat" (the selected ones), but the source text refers to a single "selected address".

Correct translation:
Allattorsimaffimminngaanniit toqqagaq peeruk
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>Peeruk</translation>
    
YES: The provided translation is incorrect. The word "Peeruk" does not mean "Delete" in any known language. The context provided is Bitcoin.
Correct translation: Poortuq
```

```
        <source>New passphrase</source>
        <translation>Isissutissaq nutaaq sanajuk</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. "sanajuk" means "builder" or "craftsman", which is not relevant to the context of a passphrase. The correct translation for "New passphrase" in Greenlandic is "Atortissatitut nalunaarusiatut siutitut nutaaq" or "Oqaatsitut nalunaarusiatut siutitut nutaaq".

Correct translation: Isissutissaq nutaaq
```

```
        <source>Show passphrase</source>
        <translation>Isissutissaq nuisiguk</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate. "Isissutissaq nuisiguk" translates to "Show the access code/password". The correct translation for "Show passphrase" would be "Isissutitigut tusagassiuppugut".
Isissutitigut tusagassiuppugut
```

```
        <source>Encrypt wallet</source>
        <translation>Aningaasiviit kode-leruk</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and nonsensical. The correct translation for "Encrypt wallet" in Greenlandic would be "Aningaasivik kode-lerneq".
NO, The translation is unproblematic.
```

```
        <source>%1 h</source>
        <translation>%1 t</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect. The English text "%1 h" likely refers to "1 hour" or "1 handshake" in the context of Bitcoin, and the translation "%1 t" is not a meaningful equivalent. The correct translation would depend on the specific context of "h", but if it means "hour," then "%1 o'clock" or "%1 time unit" might be appropriate. Without more context, a direct translation of "h" is not possible. However, if "h" is meant to signify "hour", the correct translation would be "%1 val." The correct translation is "%1 val."
```

```
        <source>Amount: %1
</source>
        <translation>Bitcoin amerlassusaa: %1
</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and likely mistranslated due to an incorrect language identifier. The provided text does not resemble any known language, and the word "Bitcoin amerlassusaa" is not a recognized phrase. Assuming 'kl' refers to Greenlandic (Kalaallisut), a more appropriate translation for "Amount:" in this context would be "Beløb:".

Correct translation:
Bitcoin beluilerneranik: %1
```

```
        <source>Label</source>
        <translation>Taajuut</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Label" in the context of Bitcoin usually refers to a descriptive name for a transaction or address. The provided translation "Taajuut" means "frequency" in Finnish. The correct translation for "Label" in Finnish would be "Otsikko" or "Nimike".

Correct translation: Otsikko
```

```
        <source>Welcome to %1.</source>
        <translation>Tikilluarit uunga %1</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and problematic as it does not convey the intended meaning of "Welcome to %1." The provided translation "Tikilluarit uunga %1" seems to be a literal and incorrect translation of "Welcome to you %1." The correct way to say "Welcome to %1" in Kalaallisut (kl) is "Aluu %1-mi".
Tikilluarit %1-mut
```
