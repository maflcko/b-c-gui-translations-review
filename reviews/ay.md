        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Kunaqataki qhanstki uka taban datos mä archivo uka qillqt'aña</translation>
    
YES
The translation is awkward and does not accurately convey the intended meaning. "Kunaqataki qhanstki" is unclear, and the structure does not match the source. A more accurate translation in Aymara would clarify the intent of exporting tab data to a file.

Correct translation:
Jichha taban utjki ukan datos archivo ukaru apsuña
```

```
        <source>Export Address List</source>
        <translation>Dirección lista apnaqaña</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. "Dirección lista apnaqaña" is a literal and awkward calque from Spanish meaning "To use address list" or just an unclear phrase in Aymara.

A better translation for "Export Address List" in Aymara would be:
"Dirección jisk'a tantiy qillqañataki" (if addressing an export/write operation for a list of addresses).

However, since Aymara digital and financial terminology is limited, it can also be made clearer via explanation or by borrowing the word "exportar" in some contexts, e.g.: "Dirección lista apaqaña" ("To export address list").

Correct translation:
Dirección lista apaqaña
```

```
        <source>Receiving addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>Dirección jichhatañani - %1</translation>
