# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Export Address List</source>
        <translation>Dirección lista apnaqaña</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because "Dirección lista apnaqaña" does not accurately convey "Export Address List" in Aymara. "Dirección" is a borrowing from Spanish and "apnaqaña" means "to use" rather than "to export". Also, the word order does not match natural Aymara phrasing, and it is not clear or idiomatic.

Correct translation:
"Dirección" could be acceptable if no Aymara equivalent exists for "address" in this technical context, but "export" should be properly translated as "apnaqay" or similar (which means "to take out" or "export"), and "list" is "lista" (again, a Spanish loan, but common in technical contexts), or you could use "qillqa" (writing or document).

A more accurate translation (retaining common technical borrowings):
"Dirección lista apnaqapxañataki"
Or
"Dirección lista apnaqaña" (if space constraints and hybrid technical language are acceptable, but with improved ordering)

But ideally:
"Dirección lista jithqt’aña" (using "jithqt’aña", meaning "to export or take out")
