```
        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>Ch'iqwa q'ipiñataki dirección ukhamarak sutin lurañatak q'ipiña.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is not accurate and is problematic because it seems to be a mix of Spanish and an indigenous language (likely Quechua). The phrase "Ch'iqwa q'ipiñataki" is not standard Spanish or a recognizable translation for "Right-click". Additionally, the phrasing "dirección ukhamarak sutin lurañatak q'ipiña" is grammatically incorrect and nonsensical in this context.

A correct translation into Spanish (assuming the user intended Spanish, given the context of Bitcoin and some Spanish words) would be:
"Haz clic derecho para editar la dirección o etiqueta"
```

```
        <source>Create a new address</source>
        <translation>Mä machaq dirección luraña.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is too literal and does not make sense in the context of Bitcoin addresses.

Correct translation: M new address ruway.
```

```
        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>Nayraqat ajllit dirección sistema clipboard uruñataki qillqt'aña</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic. The phrase "Nayraqat ajllit" is likely a mistranslation of "Copy the currently selected". The intended meaning of the source text is to copy the address to the clipboard. The provided translation uses words that do not convey this meaning accurately.

Correct translation: Copiar la dirección seleccionada actualmente al portapapeles del sistema
```

```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>Nayraqat ajllit dirección lista taypiqat apaqaña</translation>
    
YES: The translation is not accurate and is problematic. The 'ay' language seems to be a constructed language, possibly based on Quechua, but the provided translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The terms used do not align with common Bitcoin terminology or general Spanish usage.

Correct translation: Eliminar la dirección seleccionada actualmente de la lista
```

```
        <source>Enter address or label to search</source>
        <translation>Thaqhañataki dirección ukhamarak suti qillqt'aña</translation>
    
YES, The word "Thaqhañataki" translates to "to search" or "for searching." However, the context implies "enter to search," meaning "search for." The current translation sounds like "enter, for searching."

Correct translation: Thaqhañataki, maynuq'utätaki</translation>
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Kunaqataki qhanstki uka taban datos mä archivo uka qillqt'aña</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses the verb "qillqt'aña" which means "to write", but the source text says "export". There is a mismatch between "export" and "write". The term "export" is often translated as "taqxirayawqaña" or "jawst'uña" in contexts related to data transfer. Additionally, "datos" is a direct borrowing from Spanish, and while commonly understood, a more indigenous term like "pallqanakani" (things gathered/collected) or "qhata" (information) might be preferred for a more complete translation. However, "datos" is a common loanword.

Correct translation:
Kunaqataki qhanstki uka taban datos mä archivo uka taqxirayawqaña</translation>
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>Qullanaca apayañataki dirección ajllaña</translation>
    
YES: The translation is nonsensical and does not convey the meaning of the source text. The word "apayañataki" is not a recognized word in any Spanish dialect.

Correct translation: Elija la dirección a la que enviar monedas
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Qullanaca apayañataki dirección ajllaña</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the word "ay" is not a recognized language. The translation appears to be gibberish and does not convey the meaning of the source text. There is no correct translation for this language.
```

```
        <source>Choose</source>
        <translation>Ajlliña</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it uses a word that is not standard for the Quechua language. The word "Ajlliña" is not a recognized term for "Choose" in Quechua. A more appropriate translation would be "Akllana".

YES, Ajlliña
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Aka jichhürunakawa qillqatanaka Bitcoin dirección apayañataki. Jichha apayañkamaxa, jichhapuni chhantirinaka ukhamarak dirección uñjañamaya.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and uses words that do not seem to belong to the target language. The translation also fails to convey the original meaning of the source text. A more accurate translation would be: "Kuna Bitcoin direcciones ukax jichhurunakaru uñjañapataki apayañatakix utjaskiti. Jichha apayañkamax, jichhapuni chhantirinaka ukhamarak jalsu dirección uñjañamaya."
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</source>
        <translation>Aka jichhürunakawa Bitcoin dirección jichha qullqi katuqañataki. Machaqa katuqaña dirección lurañataki, 'Mä machaq katuqaña dirección luraña' botón ukaxa receive taban apnaqamaya.
Firmaña ukaxa 'legacy' tipo direcciónkunakampikiwa posible.</translation>
    
YES: The translation is problematic because it uses outdated or potentially offensive terminology. The word "jichhürunakawa" is an outdated and potentially offensive term for "your" in Aymara. A more respectful and common term would be "jumanakaru" or "jumaru". Additionally, the term "dirección" is a Spanish loanword, and while understandable, a more accurate Aymara term for "address" in this context would be "utaña".

Correct Translation: Aka jumanakaru Bitcoin utaña qullqi katuqañataki. Machaqa katuqaña utaña lurasiñataki, 'Mä machaq katuqaña utaña luraña' ukaxa receive taban apnaqañama.
Firmaña ukaxa 'legacy' tipo utañanakampikiwa lurasi.
```

```
        <source>Export Address List</source>
        <translation>Dirección lista apnaqaña</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it incorrectly translates "Export Address List" into 'ay'. The word "apnaqaña" in 'ay' means "to take away" or "to remove," which is the opposite of "export." Additionally, "lista apnaqaña" is not a grammatically correct or natural way to express the concept of exporting a list in 'ay'.

Correct translation: "Dirección khata apuna"
```

```
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>Comanakamp jayt'at archivo</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect. The correct translation should be "Archivo separado por comas".
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>Archivo separado por comas</translation>
```

```
        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>Dirección lista imañatakixa pantjasiwayi  %1. Mayampiru purt'amaya.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic as it uses incorrect grammar and vocabulary for the target language. The phrase "Dirección lista imañatakixa pantjasiwayi" is grammatically incorrect and doesn't convey the intended meaning of "address list". The word "imañatakixa" seems to be a made-up word. "pantjasiwayi" also seems to be an incorrect verb form. The word "purt'amaya" also appears to be an incorrect verb form for "try again."

A more accurate translation would be:

YES. Error de guarda de la lista de direcciones a %1. Inténtelo de nuevo.
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>Dirección apayñani - %1</translation>
    
YES - The translation is not a valid word in the specified language 'ay'.
Correct translation: Sending addresses - %1
```

```
        <source>Receiving addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>Dirección jichhatañani - %1</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses archaic Spanish ("jichhatañani") which is not appropriate for a modern context like Bitcoin. The correct translation for "Receiving addresses" in Spanish is "Direcciones de recepción".

NO
```

```
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>Comanakamp jayt'at archivo</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect. The correct translation should be "Archivo separado por comas".
        <source>Comma separated file</source>
        <extracomment>Expanded name of the CSV file format. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values.</extracomment>
        <translation>Archivo separado por comas</translation>
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Kunaqataki qhanstki uka taban datos mä archivo uka qillqt'aña</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses the verb "qillqt'aña" which means "to write", but the source text says "export". There is a mismatch between "export" and "write". The term "export" is often translated as "taqxirayawqaña" or "jawst'uña" in contexts related to data transfer. Additionally, "datos" is a direct borrowing from Spanish, and while commonly understood, a more indigenous term like "pallqanakani" (things gathered/collected) or "qhata" (information) might be preferred for a more complete translation. However, "datos" is a common loanword.

Correct translation:
Kunaqataki qhanstki uka taban datos mä archivo uka taqxirayawqaña</translation>
```
