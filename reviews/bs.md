```
        <source>Sent transaction</source>
        <translation>Pošalji transakciju</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Pošalji transakciju" means "Send transaction" in Bosnian, which is an imperative form. The English source "Sent transaction" refers to a transaction that has already been sent (past tense, adjective/noun phrase), so the correct translation should reflect that.

Correct translation:
Poslana transakcija
```

```
        <source>Create wallet warning</source>
        <translation>Stvorite upozorenje novčanika</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Stvorite upozorenje novčanika" is incorrect. "Stvorite" is the imperative plural form of "to create," which is inappropriate here as the phrase is a noun phrase, not a command. The correct translation for "Create wallet warning" (as a noun phrase, e.g., a dialog title) would be:

"Upozorenje o stvaranju novčanika"
```

```
        <source>The configuration file could not be opened.</source>
        <translation>Konfiguracijski falj nije bilo moguce otvoriti.</translation>
    
YES  
There is a spelling mistake in the word "falj" which should be "fajl" in Bosnian. Also, the phrase "nije bilo moguće otvoriti" is slightly awkward; a more natural phrasing is "nije se mogao otvoriti" (if referring to the file, masculine noun) or "nije bilo moguće otvoriti" is understandable but less common.

Correct translation:  
Konfiguracijski fajl se nije mogao otvoriti.
