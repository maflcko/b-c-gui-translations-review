```
        <source>Sent transaction</source>
        <translation>Pošalji transakciju</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Pošalji transakciju" means "Send transaction" (imperative), while the English source "Sent transaction" is the past participle (indicating that the transaction has already been sent). The translation should reflect that the transaction has been sent.

Correct translation:
Poslana transakcija
```

```
        <source>Create wallet warning</source>
        <translation>Stvorite upozorenje novčanika</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Stvorite upozorenje novčanika" means "Create a wallet warning", which suggests creating a warning rather than being a notification that there is a warning during wallet creation. The likely intended context is a message or dialog titled "Create wallet warning" (i.e., a warning shown upon creating a wallet), not an action to create a warning.

Correct translation:
Upozorenje pri kreiranju novčanika

Or, more literally:
Upozorenje za kreiranje novčanika
```

```
        <source>The configuration file could not be opened.</source>
        <translation>Konfiguracijski falj nije bilo moguce otvoriti.</translation>
    
YES
There is a typographical error: "falj" should be "fajl", and "moguce" should be "moguće" (with proper diacritic). Additionally, it would be more natural to say "Konfiguracijski fajl nije moguće otvoriti." (no need for "bilo").

Correct translation:
Konfiguracijski fajl nije moguće otvoriti.
