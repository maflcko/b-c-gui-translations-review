# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Sent transaction</source>
        <translation>Pošalji transakciju</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses an imperative verb ("Pošalji" - Send) where the source text uses a noun phrase ("Sent transaction" - Poslana transakcija). This is not a direct or accurate translation.

Pošalji transakciju
```

```
        <source>Create wallet warning</source>
        <translation>Stvorite upozorenje novčanika</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The source text "Create wallet warning" is a title or a heading. The translation "Stvorite upozorenje novčanika" translates to "Create a wallet warning" which is grammatically incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of Bitcoin. A more appropriate translation would be "Upozorenje o stvaranju novčanika" which means "Wallet creation warning".

Upozorenje o stvaranju novčanika
```

```
        <source>The configuration file could not be opened.</source>
        <translation>Konfiguracijski falj nije bilo moguce otvoriti.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it uses the English word "falj" instead of the Bosnian word for "file".
The correct translation is: Konfiguracijski fajl nije bilo moguće otvoriti.
