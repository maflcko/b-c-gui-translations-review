        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>Exportéiert déi Dateien op der aktueller Tabell an eng Datei.</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains an error in meaning and some awkward phrasing. The source text means to export the data currently shown in the active tab to a file. The translation incorrectly translates "the data in the current tab" as "déi Dateien op der aktueller Tabell," which means "the files on the current table," mixing "tab" (a UI element) with "table" and "files" instead of "data." 

A better translation would be:
Exportéiert d'Donnéeën am aktuelle Reiter a eng Datei.

        <source>Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Gitt deen alten Passwort an den neien Passwort fir d'Portemonnaie an</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a few errors:  
1. "Passwort" is a German word; the Luxembourgish equivalent is "Passwuert".  
2. The article "den" is masculine dative, but here "alten" and "neien" should agree with "Passwuert" (das Passwuert is neuter), so it should be "den ale Passwuert" or better "den ale Passwuert" if masculine were correct, but "Passwuert" is neuter in Luxembourgish, so it should be "den alen" or possibly "den ale" depending on grammatical usage. However, in Luxembourgish the correct form is "deenen ale Passwierder" if plural or "de besteande Passwuert" if singular. But since plural is not indicated, let's use singular neuter forms. The typical phrase is "den ale Passwuert" or "deene ale Passwuert"?  
Actually, in Luxembourgish the definite article for neuter singular nominative is "d'" (like "d'Portmonni"), and the adjectives do not get "-en" ending in nominative. Given that it's the direct object, accusative may apply, so "deen ale Passwuert" (accusative masculine), but "Passwuert" is neuter, so correct accusative neuter is "d'". So the phrase should be "déi al Passwuert" (old password).  
To avoid confusion, it's simpler and more common to say:  
"Gitt d'al Passwuert an d'nei Passwuert fir d'Portemonnaie an."  
3. The ending "an" in "an" is incorrect. It means "in" or "into" and does not belong here.  
4. The English phrase uses "passphrase" twice; "Passwuert" is password. "Passphrase" could be translated as "Passphrase" or "Séchert Numm" or "Passwuert" as well.  
5. The final phrase misses a period/full stop.

Correct translation:  
"Gitt d’al al Passwuert an d’al neie Passwuert fir d’Portemonnaie an."

Alternatively, more natural Luxembourgish:  
"Gitt d’al Passwuert an d’nei Passwuert fir d’Portemonnaie an."

Note also "Portemonnaie" is normally spelled "Portmonni" in Luxembourgish.

Better final correction:  
"Gitt d’al Passwuert an d’nei Passwuert fir d’Portmonni an."

# Summary:  
- Replace "Passwort" with "Passwuert"  
- Remove the trailing "an" at the end.  
- Adjust articles and adjective endings properly.  
- Possibly replace "Portemonnaie" with "Portmonni".  
- Add final period.

Corrected translation:  
"Gitt d’al Passwuert an d’nei Passwuert fir d’Portmonni."
