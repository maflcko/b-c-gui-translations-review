        <source>Create a new address</source>
        <translation>नवं पताक्षेत्रं निर्मिञ्चतु।</translation>
    
YES
The Sanskrit translation "नवं पताक्षेत्रं निर्मिञ्चतु।" is somewhat unusual and awkward for "Create a new address." The word "पताक्षेत्रं" (patākṣetraṃ) is not a standard term for "address" (in the context of Bitcoin addresses). A better translation should use a more general or modern term for "address," such as "पता" (patā), which is commonly used in modern Sanskrit to mean "address."

Also, the verb "निर्मिञ्चतु" (let him/her create) is in an imperative form, which is good for a command, but "नवं" (new) and "पता" (address) would be simpler and clearer.

Suggested correct translation:
नवीनं पतं निर्माय।

This translates literally to "Create a new address," with "नवीनं" (new), "पतं" (address), and "निर्माय" (imperative form of 'to create').

Alternatively:
नवं पत्त्रम् निर्मातुम्।

But "पतं" is commonly used for address in modern Sanskrit usage.

Therefore, the original is awkward and non-standard. A clearer translation is recommended.

```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>वर्तमानतः चयनितं पताक्षेत्रं सूचीतः अपसार्यताम्।</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses overly formal and complex Sanskrit, and the word "पताक्षेत्रं" (meaning "field of letters") is incorrect for "address" in the Bitcoin context. The term for address in this context should more appropriately be "पत्त्रम्" or a transliteration like "पता" to indicate network or wallet address. Also, the imperative "अपसार्यताम्" (let it be removed) is fine but can be simpler.

A better translation would be:
वर्तमानतः चयनितः पत्त्रम् सूचीतः अपसार्यताम्।
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>हन्तव्यं</translation>
    
YES  
The Sanskrit translation "हन्तव्यं" means "to be killed" or "must be killed," which is not appropriate for the English word "Delete," especially in a computing or Bitcoin context. A more suitable Sanskrit word for "Delete" (meaning remove or erase) would be "अप्सृत्य" (apsṛtya) or "मेटय" (meṭaya, imperative form meaning "erase" or "remove").  

Correct translation:  
अप्सृत्य  
or  
मेटय
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>नाणकानि प्राप्तुं पताक्षेत्रं चयनयतु।</translation>
    
YES  
The Sanskrit translation is somewhat literal and awkward for the context (Bitcoin wallets/addresses). The phrase "पताक्षेत्रं" (literally meaning "field of arrows") is not correct for "address." A more appropriate Sanskrit term for "address" in this modern context could be "संकेतस्थानं" (location or address) or simply "पता" (address). Additionally, "Choosing the address to receive coins with" implies selecting an address for receiving coins, so a clearer translation could be:

"नाणकानि प्राप्तुम् उपयोज्यं संकेतस्थानं चयनयतु।"  
(Choose the address to be used to receive coins.)

This preserves the intended meaning and is more understandable in Sanskrit.

Correct translation:  
नाणकानि प्राप्तुम् उपयोज्यं संकेतस्थानं चयनयतु।
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>एते तव बिटकॉइन पताक्षेत्राणि प्रेषणाय। नाणकानि प्रेषयणस्य पूर्वं सदैव राशिं च प्राप्तिपताक्षेत्रं च परीक्षणं कुर्वीत।</translation>
    
YES  
The Sanskrit translation has some issues:

1. "पताक्षेत्राणि" is an incorrect compound for "addresses." The correct classical term would be "पताः" or "प्रेषणपतेः" (addresses for sending). The word "पताक्षेत्राणि" is an unnatural, compounded form that is not standard.

2. The phrase "एते तव बिटकॉइन पताक्षेत्राणि प्रेषणाय।" lacks a proper verb indicating "are" or "these are." Sanskrit would usually require a copula or a clearer sentence structure.

3. The phrase "नाणकानि प्रेषयणस्य पूर्वं" is awkward; "नाणकानि" (coins) should be in the accusative plural to indicate the object of sending and should be linked properly.

4. "प्राप्तिपताक्षेत्रं" is also an unnatural compound for "receiving address." A better phrasing would be "प्राप्ने पतः" or "प्राप्तिपतिः" or "प्राप्तिपता" in context.

5. Overall, the sentence is not fluid or idiomatic Sanskrit.

A better translation would be:

एतानि तव बिटकॉइनप्रेषणपता भवन्ति। नाणकानि प्रेषयितुं पूर्वं, राशिं च प्राप्तिपतं च सदैव परीक्षस्व।

Breaking down:

- एतानि तव बिटकॉइनप्रेषणपता भवन्ति। — These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments.

- नाणकानि प्रेषयितुं पूर्वं, — Before sending coins,

- राशिं च प्राप्तिपतं च सदैव परीक्षस्व। — always check the amount and the receiving address.

This translation is more grammatical, idiomatic, and preserves the meaning.

Hence, the output is:

YES  
The Sanskrit translation is awkward and contains incorrect compounds. It lacks clarity and proper sentence structure to convey the meaning faithfully and idiomatically.

Correct translation:  
एतानि तव बिटकॉइनप्रेषणपता भवन्ति। नाणकानि प्रेषयितुं पूर्वं, राशिं च प्राप्तिपतं च सदैव परीक्षस्व।
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रं प्रतिलिप्य</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "पताक्षेत्रं प्रतिलिप्य" is incorrect for "Copy Address." The word "पताक्षेत्रं" does not correctly mean "address" in this context, and "प्रतिलिप्य" is not the proper imperative form for "copy." A more accurate Sanskrit translation would use "सञ्चिका" (meaning document or file) or "संकेतस्थानम्" for address, but in the context of a Bitcoin address, it is common to transliterate or use "पता" (patā) for address.

A better translation for "Copy Address" in Sanskrit would be:  
"पता प्रतिलिप्य" or more formally imperative: "पतं प्रति (प्रतिलिपि) कुरु" ("Make a copy of the address")

However, keeping it concise and fitting UI button style:  
"पता प्रतिलिपि" (Copy Address)

Therefore, correct translation:  
<translation>पता प्रतिलिपि</translation>
```

```
        <source>Export Address List</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रसूची निर्यातयतु</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "पताक्षेत्रसूची निर्यातयतु" is problematic. The term "पताक्षेत्र" is not a standard or commonly used term for "address" in Sanskrit. In the context of Bitcoin or general address usage, "पता" (patā) or "संकेत-पता" (saṃketa-patā) would be more appropriate. Also, the imperative "निर्यातयतु" (let it be exported) may be correct but is somewhat formal and classical. A more natural and clear phrase for "Export Address List" could be:  

पता-सूची निर्यातः  

or to keep the imperative form consistent,  

पता-सूची निर्यातयतु  

Thus, a corrected version:  
पता-सूची निर्यातयतु
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्राणि प्रेषणं कुर्वन्ति - %1</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incorrect and awkward in Sanskrit. "पताक्षेत्राणि प्रेषणं कुर्वन्ति" literally means "addresses are sending" which is a nonsensical phrase in this context.

In the Bitcoin context, "Sending addresses - %1" refers to the addresses that are sending (funds), so it should be more like "प्रेषक पताः - %1" (Sender addresses - %1) or "प्रेषण पताः - %1" (Sending addresses - %1).

Correct translation:  
प्रेषण पताः - %1
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रम्</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "पताक्षेत्रम्" is incorrect for "Address" in the context of Bitcoin (a network or wallet address). "पताक्षेत्रम्" means "battlefield" or "place of battle" in Sanskrit, which is inaccurate here. The correct word should convey the meaning of an address/location or a network address.

A better translation would be:  
पत्तः (pattaḥ) — meaning "address" or "location"  
or  
पत्तालयः (pattālayaḥ) — "address/place"

Correct translation:  
<translation>पत्तः</translation>
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <extracomment>Title of Peers Table column which contains the IP/Onion/I2P address of the connected peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रम्</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "पताक्षेत्रम्" is incorrect for the term "Address" in the Bitcoin context (network or wallet address). "पताक्षेत्रम्" means "battlefield" or "field of action" in Sanskrit (sa). The correct word for address, particularly in the context of a network or location, should be something like "पत्ता" (pattā) meaning "address" or "location."  

Correct translation:  
पत्ता
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रम्</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "पताक्षेत्रम्" is incorrect for "Address" in the context of Bitcoin (a network or wallet address). "पताक्षेत्रम्" means "battlefield" or "place of battle" in Sanskrit, which is inaccurate here. The correct word should convey the meaning of an address/location or a network address.

A better translation would be:  
पत्तः (pattaḥ) — meaning "address" or "location"  
or  
पत्तालयः (pattālayaḥ) — "address/place"

Correct translation:  
<translation>पत्तः</translation>
```
