```
        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>दक्षिणक्लिक् कृत्वा पताक्षेत्रं वा लेबलं सम्पादयेत्।</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it uses Sanskrit words that are not commonly understood in a modern technical context. The use of "दक्षिणक्लिक्" (dakṣiṇaklik) for "right-click" is an awkward literal translation that doesn't fit modern computer terminology. The phrase "सम्पादयेत्" (sampādayet) is also a bit formal. A more appropriate and understandable translation would use more common or direct terms.

NO, The translation is problematic.
The translation uses overly formal and literal Sanskrit that is not idiomatic for a modern user interface.
Correct translation: उजवी-क्लिक करा पत्ता किंवा लेबल संपादित करण्यासाठी.
```

```
        <source>Create a new address</source>
        <translation>नवं पताक्षेत्रं निर्मिञ्चतु।</translation>
    
YES: The word "निर्मिञ्चतु" is a Sanskrit verb form and doesn't fit the context of creating a Bitcoin address in modern Marathi. The word "पताक्षेत्रं" is also not a standard Marathi term for "address" in this context.

Correct translation: नवीन पत्ता तयार करा.
```

```
        <source>Copy the currently selected address to the system clipboard</source>
        <translation>वर्तमानतः चयनितं पताक्षेत्रं प्रणाली क्लिपबोर्डे प्रतिलिप्यताम्।</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it uses archaic Sanskrit grammar for a modern technical context, making it difficult to understand for a typical user. It also misinterprets "address" as "address field" and "copy" as "let it be copied".

Correct translation: वर्तमान निवडलेला पत्ता सिस्टम क्लिपबोर्डवर कॉपी करा.
```

```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>वर्तमानतः चयनितं पताक्षेत्रं सूचीतः अपसार्यताम्।</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The word "पताक्षेत्रं" means "area of address" or "domain of address" and not "address". The word "अपसार्यताम्" also has a passive construction which doesn't fit the context.

Correct translation: वर्तमानतः चयनितं पतां सूचीतः अपसारयतु।
```

```
        <source>Export the data in the current tab to a file</source>
        <translation>वर्तमानताभिहितपृष्ठे स्थितान् विवरणान् सञ्चिकायां निर्यातयतु।</translation>
    
YES
The translation is grammatically incorrect and awkward in Sanskrit. It uses overly formal and complex Sanskrit vocabulary that is not appropriate for the context of a user interface or technical instruction.

Correct translation:
<translation>वर्तमान पृष्ठातील डेटा फाइलमध्ये एक्सपोर्ट करा.</translation>
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>हन्तव्यं</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to send coins to</source>
        <translation>नाणकानि प्रेषयितुं पताक्षेत्रं चयनयतु।</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "पताक्षेत्रं" (patakshetraṃ) translates to "field of address" or "address area", which is not a natural or accurate way to refer to a Bitcoin address. The correct word for "address" in this context is "पते" (pate). Additionally, the verb "चयनयतु" (chayanayatu) is an imperative form of "to choose", but a more common and natural imperative form would be "चिनुत" (chinuta) or "चयनं कुरुत" (chayanaṃ kuruta).

NO
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>नाणकानि प्राप्तुं पताक्षेत्रं चयनयतु।</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>एते तव बिटकॉइन पताक्षेत्राणि प्रेषणाय। नाणकानि प्रेषयणस्य पूर्वं सदैव राशिं च प्राप्तिपताक्षेत्रं च परीक्षणं कुर्वीत।</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic because the Sanskrit phrasing and vocabulary are unnatural and do not accurately convey the intended meaning in the context of Bitcoin. Specifically, "पताक्षेत्राणि" (address areas) is an awkward construction, and the overall sentence structure feels forced.

Here's a corrected translation:

<translation>इमानि तव बिटकॉइन-प्रेषण-पत्तन-स्थानानि सन्ति। धनं प्रेषयितुं पूर्वं राशिं च प्राप्ति-पत्तन-स्थानं च सर्वदा परीक्षयतु।</translation>
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. Use the 'Create new receiving address' button in the receive tab to create new addresses.
Signing is only possible with addresses of the type 'legacy'.</source>
        <translation>एते तव बिटकॉइन पताक्षेत्राणि प्राप्तिप्रतियोगाय। 'नवं प्राप्तिपताक्षेत्रं निर्मीयताम्' बटनं प्राप्तिपृष्ठे उपयोगयित्वा नवानि पताक्षेत्राणि निर्मीयताम्। हस्ताक्षरणं केवलं 'प्राचीन' प्रकारेण पताक्षेत्राणि उपयोग्यं अस्ति।</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses Sanskrit, which is not the intended language. The correct translation should be in Hindi.
एते आपके बिटकॉइन पते हैं जिनका उपयोग भुगतान प्राप्त करने के लिए किया जाता है। नए पते बनाने के लिए 'प्राप्त करें' टैब में 'नया प्राप्त करने वाला पता बनाएँ' बटन का उपयोग करें। हस्ताक्षर केवल 'लेगेसी' प्रकार के पतों से ही संभव हैं।
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रं प्रतिलिप्य</translation>
    
YES
The provided translation is problematic because it does not accurately convey the meaning of "Copy Address" in the context of Bitcoin. The Telugu word "क्षेत्रं" (kshetram) means "area" or "field", which is not relevant to copying an address. The word "प्रतिलिप्य" (pratilipya) means "having copied" or "to be copied", which is also not the correct form.

A more accurate translation for "Copy Address" in Telugu, especially in a technical or digital context like Bitcoin, would be:

<translation>முகவரியை நகலெடுக்கவும்</translation>
```

```
        <source>Export Address List</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रसूची निर्यातयतु</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रसूची %1 प्रति सुरक्षितुं प्रयासे दोषः अभवत्। कृपया पुनः प्रयासं कुर्वीत।</translation>
    
YES: The translation contains a grammatical error. The verb "अभवत्" (abhavat) is in the past tense, but the sentence structure implies a present or ongoing error. Additionally, "safeguard" is an awkward translation for "save".

A more accurate translation would be:
पताक्षेत्रसूची %1 प्रति सुरक्षितुं प्रयासे दोषः वर्तते। कृपया पुनः प्रयासं कुर्वीत।
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्राणि प्रेषणं कुर्वन्ति - %1</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रम्</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and does not correctly convey the meaning of "address" in the context of Bitcoin. The word "पताक्षेत्रम्" (patākshetram) in Sanskrit means "area of address" or "addressing area," which is not a direct or appropriate translation for a Bitcoin address.

A more suitable translation for "Address" in the context of Bitcoin would be "पता" (patā) or "वि ayn" (vividha-āyan) which refers to a specific wallet address.

Corrected translation: पता
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <extracomment>Title of Peers Table column which contains the IP/Onion/I2P address of the connected peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रम्</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses an incorrect term for "address" in the context of Bitcoin. The term "पताक्षेत्रम्" (patākṣetram) means "address area" or "field of address", which is not accurate for a Bitcoin address or IP address. A more appropriate translation for "Address" in this context would be "पत्ता" (pattā), which simply means "address".

NO
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>पताक्षेत्रम्</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and does not correctly convey the meaning of "address" in the context of Bitcoin. The word "पताक्षेत्रम्" (patākshetram) in Sanskrit means "area of address" or "addressing area," which is not a direct or appropriate translation for a Bitcoin address.

A more suitable translation for "Address" in the context of Bitcoin would be "पता" (patā) or "वि ayn" (vividha-āyan) which refers to a specific wallet address.

Corrected translation: पता

        <translation>वर्तमानताभिहितपृष्ठे स्थितान् विवरणान् सञ्चिकायां निर्यातयतु।</translation>
    
YES
The translation is grammatically incorrect and awkward in Sanskrit. It uses overly formal and complex Sanskrit vocabulary that is not appropriate for the context of a user interface or technical instruction.
