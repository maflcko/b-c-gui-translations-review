        <source>&amp;New</source>
        <translation>Itsva</translation>
    
ERR
The translation omits the '&' which is used for the keyboard shortcut. It should be present exactly once in the translation.

Correct translation:
&Itsva
```

        <source>&amp;Delete</source>
        <translation>Dzima</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is missing the '&' that indicates the shortcut key in the original. It should appear in the translation as well, for consistency with menu shortcuts.

Correct translation:
&Dzima
```

        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>Kero</translation>
    
ERR
The translation "Kero" is incorrect for the English word "Address" in Shona ('sn'). The correct translation should be "Kero" when referring to a postal address, but for cryptocurrency or Bitcoin context, the direct transliteration or usage of the English word "Address" is often preferred, or one can use "Kero" if sufficiently established. However, the word "Kero" means "address" in general, but may lack specificity in the Bitcoin context.

If opting for a more accurate translation considering the context (Bitcoin wallet address), it can be:

Correct translation:
Kero

So, technically, "Kero" is correct for "address", including Bitcoin contexts in Shona. No issue with whitespace or spam.

If strict, output is: NO

(But if your policy is to indicate preference for transliteration for technical terms, you can say "YES", but standard Shona dictionaries list "Kero" for "address", so "NO" is acceptable.)

        <source>E&amp;xit</source>
        <translation>Buda</translation>
    
ERR
The translation "Buda" does not include the "&" symbol, which is used for keyboard shortcuts in menu items. Additionally, "Buda" does not mean "Exit" in Shona; the correct term would be "Buda" (to go out/exit), but the shortcut (&) must be preserved.

Correct translation:
&Buda
```

        <source>Address</source>
        <extracomment>Title of Peers Table column which contains the IP/Onion/I2P address of the connected peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Kero</translation>
    
ERR
The translation of "Address" as "Kero" is incorrect in the context of the Shona ('sn') language. "Kero" is an adaptation, but the more standard and accurate term for "address" (as in IP/network address) in Shona is "Kero yeIndaneti" or simply "Kero" can suffice for a network address, provided it has been explained elsewhere in the UI. However, contextually, "Kero" is borrowed and may be unfamiliar or ambiguous to users unfamiliar with this loanword.

Correct translation (for clarity in IT/Bitcoin context):
Kero

No major whitespace or format issues, but the rationale and transparency of language usage could be improved for user clarity. If further specificity is needed for peer tech tables: "Kero yeIndaneti" or "Kero yeNetiweki" could be preferable.

Final verdict: NO (if "Kero" is acceptable as a technical term in your target context)
Or
ERR
"Kero" may be ambiguous to non-technical users. For exactness, use "Kero yeIndaneti".

Correct translation:
Kero yeIndaneti

(If your UI already establishes "Kero" as "address": "NO", otherwise, "YES ...")
```
