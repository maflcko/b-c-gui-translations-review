# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>Kero</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The Shona word "Kero" does not accurately translate to "Address" in the context of Bitcoin. In Shona, "address" in the sense of a physical location or a web address is usually translated as "kero" or "kero rekero". However, in the context of Bitcoin, a more appropriate translation for a wallet address would be "kero yemari yemagetsi" or simply "kero yemagetsi".

The correct translation should be:

        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>Kero yemagetsi</translation>
```

```
        <source>Exit</source>
        <translation>Buda</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The Shona word for "Exit" is "Buda" but it is used as a verb meaning "to go out" or "to leave". In this context, a noun meaning "exit" would be more appropriate. The correct translation would be "Kubuda".

Buda
```

```
        <source>Quit application</source>
        <translation>Vhara Application</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic as it does not accurately convey the meaning of "Quit application" in the context of Bitcoin. The provided Shona word "Vhara" translates to "close" or "shut" which might be misleading. A more appropriate translation would be "Buda muchirongwa" which means "Exit the application" or "End the application".

Correct translation: Buda muchirongwa
```

        <extracomment>Title of Peers Table column which contains the IP/Onion/I2P address of the connected peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Kero</translation>
    
YES - The translation of "Address" to "Kero" is incorrect. In the context of Bitcoin, "address" should be translated to a term that refers to an address or location. The correct translation for "Address" in Shona is "Kero".
Kero
