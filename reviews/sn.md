# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>Kero</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "Address" to "Kero" is problematic. In the Shona language ('sn'), the correct word for "Address" is "Kero" only in contexts involving an address for mailing or a physical location, but in the context of Bitcoin, it refers to a cryptocurrency address or wallet address. The correct translation should be "Kero" only if Shona Bitcoin users commonly understand it for a digital/address context. However, in actual cryptocurrency contexts, "Kero" is generally accepted for "address" among Shona speakers.

If additional context is needed, "Kero yeBitcoin" (Bitcoin Address) may be used to provide clarity in ambiguous contexts.

So strictly:
NO

But with a minor note:
"Kero" is commonly used in informal/modern contexts for both physical and digital addresses among Shona speakers. If full clarity is needed, you may use "Kero yeBitcoin".

        <source>Exit</source>
        <translation>Buda</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Buda" is incorrect for "Exit" in Shona ('sn'). The correct translation should be "Buda" can mean "come out" or "leave," but for interface terminology, a more suitable translation would be "Kubuda" (meaning "to exit/leave") or simply "Buda". However, some users would prefer the infinitive for clarity in interfaces.

Correct translation:
Kubuda
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <extracomment>Title of Peers Table column which contains the IP/Onion/I2P address of the connected peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Kero</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Kero" is not correct for "Address" in the context of Bitcoin or networking. The correct Shona translation is "Kero ye IP" or simply "Kero", but "Kero" alone is often understandable as "address" (e.g., email address, postal address). However, in the context of Bitcoin or network addresses, to avoid ambiguity, "Kero ye IP" or "Kero ye network" could be clearer.

Correct translation:
Kero ye IP

But if "Address" is consistently translated as "Kero" elsewhere in the app, and the meaning is clear to the users, "Kero" might be acceptable. However, "Kero ye IP" is preferable for clarity in a technical context.
