```
        <source>New</source>
        <translation>新增 N</translation>
    
YES
The translation "新增 N" is incorrect. The "N" is extraneous and not standard in Cantonese ('yue'). It should be simply "新增", which correctly conveys "New" in this context.

Correct translation:
新增
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>刪除 D</translation>
    
YES
The translation "刪除 D" is problematic. The "D" does not belong in the translation and appears to be an error. The correct translation in Cantonese ('yue'), using Chinese characters, would be simply:

刪除

Correct translation:
刪除
```

```
        <source>Passphrase change failed</source>
        <translation>修改密码失败</translation>
    
YES
The translation is in Simplified Chinese (zh_CN), not Cantonese (yue). While "修改密码失败" means "Passphrase change failed" in Mandarin, the Cantonese translation should use appropriate wording and vocabulary.

Correct translation:
更改密碼失敗
```

```
        <source>Runaway exception</source>
        <translation>未捕获的异常</translation>
    
YES
The translation "未捕获的异常" is in Simplified Chinese (Mandarin), not Cantonese ('yue'), and it is also more formal than typical conversational Cantonese. Additionally, "未捕获的异常" translates to "uncaught exception," which is not the same nuance as "runaway exception." A better Cantonese translation would reflect the meaning and use colloquial 'yue'.

Correct translation:
有异常走甩咗
```

```
        <source>About %1</source>
        <translation>关于 %1 (A)</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses "关于", which is Mandarin ("zh_CN"), not Cantonese ('yue'). Also, "(A)" is extraneous and should not be present. 

Correct translation:
關於 %1
```

```
        <source>Change Passphrase…</source>
        <translation>修改密码(C)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "修改密码(C)" is in Simplified Chinese, not in Cantonese ('yue'). Also, the original uses an ellipsis (…), but the translation omits it and adds "(C)", which is not present in the source.

Correct translation:
換密碼…
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>卸载钱包</translation>
    
YES
The translation "卸载钱包" means "uninstall wallet", which is incorrect. The correct translation for "Close wallet" in Cantonese ('yue') should be "關閉錢包" or, in a more colloquial way, "收埋錢包".

Correct translation:
關閉錢包
```

```
        <source>Enable network activity</source>
        <extracomment>A context menu item. The network activity was disabled previously.</extracomment>
        <translation>關閉網路紀錄</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. The English "Enable network activity" means to turn ON network activity, but the translation "關閉網路紀錄" means "Turn OFF network record/log," which is the opposite and uses "紀錄" which more accurately means "record" or "log" rather than "activity". There is also a change in meaning.

Correct translation:
啟用網絡活動
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>复制和数量</translation>
    
YES
The translation "复制和数量" means "Copy and amount", which is incorrect. The correct translation for "Copy amount" in Cantonese ('yue') should be "複製金額" or "複製數量" depending on the context (usually "複製金額" for Bitcoin). Also, the translation used Simplified Chinese "复制" instead of the usual Traditional "複製" that is more standard in Cantonese contexts.

Correct translation:
複製金額
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>卸载钱包</translation>
    
YES
The translation "卸载钱包" means "uninstall wallet", which is incorrect. The correct translation for "Close wallet" in Cantonese ('yue') should be "關閉錢包" or, in a more colloquial way, "收埋錢包".

Correct translation:
關閉錢包
```

```
        <source>When you click OK, %1 will begin to download and process the full %4 block chain (%2 GB) starting with the earliest transactions in %3 when %4 initially launched.</source>
        <translation>當你點擊「確認」，%1會開始下載，並從%3年最早的交易，處裡整個%4區塊鏈(大小:%2GB)</translation>
    
YES
There are translation issues:

1. The wording "處裡" should be the Cantonese term "處理".
2. The translation omits essential details such as "starting with the earliest transactions in %3 when %4 initially launched" (the launch time and association with %4).
3. The parenthesis and formatting around "%2 GB" does not match the English source.
4. There is inconsistent use of punctuation/spaces; e.g., “(大小:%2GB)” introduces unnecessary wording and omits the space before 'GB'.

Correct translation:
當你點擊「確認」，%1會開始下載並處理完整的%4區塊鏈（%2 GB），由%4最初推出時%3年最早的交易開始。

Explanation: This keeps the meaning, includes all necessary format specifiers, and uses proper punctuation/formatting per the source.
```

```
        <source>Full path to a %1 compatible script (e.g. C:\Downloads\hwi.exe or /Users/you/Downloads/hwi.py). Beware: malware can steal your coins!</source>
        <translation>与%1兼容的脚本文件路径（例如 C:\Downloads\hwi.exe 或者 /Users/you/Downloads/hwi.py ）。注意：恶意软件可以偷币！</translation>
    
YES
The translation is in Simplified Chinese, not Cantonese ('yue'). It uses Mandarin vocabulary (e.g., "兼容", "脚本文件路径", "恶意软件", "偷币"), not Cantonese.

Correct translation:
%1兼容嘅script完整路径（例如 C:\Downloads\hwi.exe 或 /Users/you/Downloads/hwi.py）。留意：恶意软件可以偷你啲币！
```

```
        <source>Spend unconfirmed change</source>
        <translation>动用尚未确认的找零资金(S)</translation>
    
YES
The translation is in Simplified Chinese, not in Cantonese (Yue). It uses formal Mandarin phrasing rather than colloquial Cantonese.

Correct translation:
用未確認嘅找續银（S）
```

```
        <source>Your current balance in watch-only addresses</source>
        <translation>您当前在仅观察观察地址中的余额</translation>
    
YES
The translation is in Simplified Chinese and not in the Cantonese 'yue' language as expected. Additionally, it repeats "观察" (observe) twice, which is awkward.

Correct translation:
你而家喺僅供觀察地址嘅餘額
```

```
        <source>Save…</source>
        <translation>拯救...</translation>
    
YES
The translation "拯救..." is incorrect. The English word "Save" in the context of software (e.g. saving a file) should be translated as "儲存" or "保存" in Cantonese ('yue'), not "拯救" which means "rescue" or "save (from danger)". Also, the ellipsis should be the Chinese version "…" not three periods "...".

Correct translation:
儲存…
```

```
        <source>Cannot start bitcoin: click-to-pay handler</source>
        <translation>无法启动 bitcoin: 协议的“一键支付”处理程序</translation>
    
YES
The translation is written in Simplified Chinese (Mandarin), not in 'yue' (Cantonese). Furthermore, for a proper Cantonese translation, the register should be more conversational and regionally accurate.

Correct translation:
冇办法启动bitcoin：click-to-pay处理程序
```

```
        <source>Hide Peers Detail</source>
        <translation>隐藏其他人的详细信息</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The 'yue' language is Cantonese, and this translation is in Simplified Chinese suitable for Mandarin ("隐藏其他人的详细信息"), which is not colloquial Cantonese and does not match the tone or vocabulary expected for a 'yue' translation. 

Correct translation:
收埋節點詳情

Explanation:
- "Peers" should be "節點" in a Bitcoin context (meaning network nodes/peers).
- "Hide" in Cantonese is commonly "收埋".
- "詳情" means "details" in Cantonese.
- "其他人" means "other people", which is not accurate for "peers" in this context.
```

```
        <source>Outbound Address Fetch: short-lived, for soliciting addresses</source>
        <extracomment>Explanatory text for a short-lived outbound peer connection that is used to request addresses from a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Outbound 地址取得: 用於短暫，暫時 測試地址</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and awkward in its structure:
- The phrase "暫時 測試地址" means "temporarily test address," which changes the meaning from "soliciting" (requesting addresses). 
- The translation fails to convey "for soliciting addresses," which refers to requesting, not testing.
- Also, "Outbound" should be translated or explained, especially in a Chinese context.

Correct translation:
"外發地址獲取：短暫，用嚟向其他節點請求地址"
```

```
        <source>1 hour</source>
        <translation>1 小时(H)</translation>
    
YES
The translation uses "小时", which is Mandarin, not Cantonese (Yue). The correct Cantonese word for hour is "鐘" (or "個鐘" in colloquial speech). Also, the "(H)" annotation is unnecessary unless it is present in the source.

Correct translation:
1個鐘
```

```
        <source>Ban for</source>
        <translation>禁止連線</translation>
    
YES
The translation "禁止連線" means "prohibit connection" or "ban connection", which does not accurately reflect the original source "Ban for", which typically expects a duration or context after "for" (e.g., "Ban for 1 hour"). The translation omits the sense of duration implied by "for" and is therefore incomplete.

Correct translation:
封禁時長

This better preserves the meaning, implying "Ban duration" or "Ban for (time)".
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>复制和数量</translation>
    
YES
The translation "复制和数量" means "Copy and amount", which is incorrect. The correct translation for "Copy amount" in Cantonese ('yue') should be "複製金額" or "複製數量" depending on the context (usually "複製金額" for Bitcoin). Also, the translation used Simplified Chinese "复制" instead of the usual Traditional "複製" that is more standard in Cantonese contexts.

Correct translation:
複製金額
```

```
        <source>Please, review your transaction proposal. This will produce a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) which you can save or copy and then sign with e.g. an offline %1 wallet, or a PSBT-compatible hardware wallet.</source>
        <extracomment>Text to inform a user attempting to create a transaction of their current options. At this stage, a user can only create a PSBT. This string is displayed when private keys are disabled and an external signer is not available.</extracomment>
        <translation>請檢查您的交易提案。這將產生部分簽名的比特幣交易（PSBT），您可以儲存或複製該交易，然後使用簽名。離線%1錢包或與PSBT相容的硬體錢包。</translation>
    
YES  
There are two issues with the translation:  
1. The sentence "然後使用簽名。" is incomplete and unnatural. The meaning of "然後使用簽名。" (then use signing) has missing information—it's unclear what is being signed or how, and it was meant to continue to the next part about the offline wallet or hardware wallet.  
2. The phrase "離線%1錢包" is missing the proper spacing. Also, the original text says "with e.g. an offline %1 wallet, or a PSBT-compatible hardware wallet," but the translation separates these items poorly.  

Correct translation:  
請檢查您嘅交易提案。呢個操作會產生一個部分簽名嘅比特幣交易（PSBT），您可以儲存或者複製佢，之後好似用離線%1錢包，又或者支持PSBT嘅硬件錢包簽名。

Explanation:  
- The structure is now clear and colloquial for 'yue'.  
- The usage of %1 is preserved and placed appropriately.  
- There are no stray spaces or double spaces.  
- The meaning is faithful and clear.
```

```
        <source>The Bitcoin address to send the payment to</source>
        <translation>將支付發送到的比特幣地址給</translation>
    
YES
The translation is awkward and includes an unnecessary particle "給" at the end, which is ungrammatical in Cantonese. A more natural translation would be:
用嚟收款嘅比特幣地址 or 將支付發送去嘅比特幣地址

Correct translation:
用嚟收款嘅比特幣地址
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>复制和数量</translation>
    
YES
The translation "复制和数量" means "Copy and amount", which is incorrect. The correct translation for "Copy amount" in Cantonese ('yue') should be "複製金額" or "複製數量" depending on the context (usually "複製金額" for Bitcoin). Also, the translation used Simplified Chinese "复制" instead of the usual Traditional "複製" that is more standard in Cantonese contexts.

Correct translation:
複製金額
```

```
        <source>Error: Dumpfile identifier record is incorrect. Got "%s", expected "%s".</source>
        <translation>
錯誤：轉存檔案識別記錄不正確。獲得%s，預期
%s。</translation>
    
YES
There is a formatting issue: unnecessary newlines and missing proper format specifier integration. Also, the use of "獲得" is not natural in Cantonese for "got". "得到" or simply quoting is more natural. The translation should be concise, and "%s" should be integrated naturally.

Correct translation:
錯誤：轉存檔案標識記錄唔正確。實際為「%s」，預期為「%s」。
```

```
        <source>More than one onion bind address is provided. Using %s for the automatically created Tor onion service.</source>
        <translation>提供多數TOR路由綁定位址。 對自動建立的Tor服務用%s</translation>
    
YES
The translation is understandable but has several issues:
- "提供多數TOR路由綁定位址。" is awkward and not colloquial in Cantonese ('yue').
- "TOR路由" is not the optimal or widely used term in Cantonese; using "onion" or transliterating "onion address" is more common.
- There is an extraneous space before "對自動建立的Tor服務用%s".
- "%s" is preserved correctly, but the translation doesn't reflect "the automatically created Tor onion service" clearly and specifically.

Correct translation:
提供咗多個onion綁定地址。會用%s做自動建立嘅Tor onion服務。

This version is more conversational and closer to expected Cantonese usage, and correctly reflects the source meaning.
```

```
        <source>Error: Dumpfile checksum does not match. Computed %s, expected %s</source>
        <translation>錯誤：轉存檔案的校驗和不匹配。%s計算得%s</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and incomplete. It omits "expected %s" (預期為%s) and does not preserve the original English format. Additionally, there should be a space after the colon for better readability, which is common in Cantonese localization.

Correct translation:
錯誤：轉存檔案的校驗和不匹配。計算得%s，預期為%s
```

```
        <source>Failure removing transaction: %s</source>
        <translation>%s删除交易时失败: </translation>
    
YES
There are two issues: (1) The format specifier %s has been moved to the front, which changes the intended sentence structure, (2) there is an unnecessary space before the colon, and (3) the translation omits part of the message after the colon.

Correct translation:
删除交易时失败：%s
```

```
        <source>Fee rate (%s) is lower than the minimum fee rate setting (%s)</source>
        <translation>手续费率 (%s) 低于最大手续费率设置 (%s)</translation>
    
YES
The translation incorrectly translates "minimum fee rate setting" as "最大手续费率设置," which means "maximum fee rate setting." It should be "最低手续费率设置" to accurately convey "minimum fee rate setting" in Cantonese.

Correct translation:
手续费率 (%s) 低于最低手续费率设置 (%s)
```

```
        <source>Transaction amounts must not be negative</source>
        <translation>交易金额不不可为负数</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains a redundancy: "不不可为负数" is a double negative, which is incorrect. In Cantonese (yue), it should simply state "唔可以係負數" or "不得為負數". Also, "金额" can be "金額" or colloquially "數額", but "金额" is still understandable.

Correct translation:
交易金額唔可以係負數
```

```
        <source>Transaction change output index out of range</source>
        <translation>交易尋找零輸出項超出範圍</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate. The phrase "交易尋找零輸出項超出範圍" literally means "Transaction finding zero output item out of range", which does not accurately render "Transaction change output index out of range". "Change output" should refer to the change output in a Bitcoin transaction (the output returning the remaining funds to the user), not "尋找零" (finding zero).

Correct translation:
交易找續輸出索引超出範圍

Explanation:
- "找續" is the accurate Cantonese term for "change" (as in money returned).
- "輸出索引" for "output index".
- The rest keeps the meaning and technical accuracy.
```

```
        <source>Wallet file creation failed: %s</source>
        <translation>钱包文件创建失败：1%s</translation>
    
YES
There is an error in the translation: "1%s" appears to be a typographical mistake. The correct translation should preserve the format specifier as in the source, i.e., "%s" without the extra "1".

Correct translation:
钱包文件创建失败：%s
```

Number of issues: 32.
