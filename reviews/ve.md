        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>Kha vha puṱedze nga tsha u ḽa u itela u shandula ḓiresi kana ḽebuḽu</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. It appears to be a literal translation that doesn't make sense in the context of Bitcoin or typical user interface instructions. The phrasing "Kha vha puṱedze nga tsha u ḽa" translates to something like "Please bite/chew with something to eat," which is completely out of place.

The correct translation should be:
"Kha vha pfundudze uri hu dzhene vhuḓo kha ḓiresi kana ḽebuḽu" or more naturally, "vhulaani kha ḓiresi kana ḽebuḽu u itela u dzhena vhuḓo".

Here's a breakdown of the original intent and the problematic translation:
*   **Source:** "Right-click to edit address or label"
*   **Problematic Translation:** "Kha vha puṱedze nga tsha u ḽa u itela u shandula ḓiresi kana ḽebuḽu"
*   **Explanation of Problem:** The phrase "puṱedze nga tsha u ḽa" is nonsensical in this context. It's a literal translation of "bite/chew with something to eat" which is unrelated to editing an address. The rest of the translation is also awkward.

**Corrected Translation (Venda):**

"Kha vha tsvukanye u itela u alusa ḓiresi kana ḽebuḽu" or "vhulaani kha ḓiresi kana ḽebuḽu u itela u alusa" is a more accurate and understandable translation for editing an address or label.

NO

```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>Tshivhambadzwaseli</translation>
    
YES, The translation "Tshivhambadzwaseli" is not an accurate translation of "Export" in the context of Bitcoin or generally. "Tshivhambadzwaseli" is a word from the Venda language which means "exporter" (a person or entity that exports) rather than the act or function of exporting. The correct translation for "Export" as a verb or noun referring to the action of exporting data or files is "Bhuritsa" or "Ngozha".

NO, The translation is unproblematic.
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>Thutha</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "Delete" in the context of Bitcoin (likely referring to deleting a transaction or address) is a strong action. "Thutha" is a word in Chichewa that means "to follow" or "to walk behind". This translation is inaccurate and doesn't convey the intended meaning at all.

NO
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Khethani ḓiresi ine na ḓo ṱanganedza ngayo tshelede ya tsimbi nga .</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it includes a trailing period after the format specifier, which is incorrect.
Khethani ḓiresi ine na ḓo ṱanganedza ngayo tshelede ya tsimbi.
```

```
        <source>These are your Bitcoin addresses for sending payments. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.</source>
        <translation>Hedzi ndi ḓiresi dzaṋu dza Bitcoin dza u rumela mbadelo. Tshifhinga tshoṱhe ṱolani tshelede na ḓiresi ine na ḓo i ṱanganedza musi ni sa athu rumela tshelede ya tsimbi.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of the original English text. The phrase "Tshifhinga tshoṱhe ṱolani tshelede" literally translates to "Always check the money," but the English text refers to checking the "amount" and the "receiving address." The second part of the sentence, "na ḓiresi ine na ḓo i ṱanganedza musi ni sa athu rumela tshelede ya tsimbi," translates to "and the address you will receive it with before sending the metal money," which is also incorrect.

Correct translation: Hedzi ndi ḓiresi dzaṋu dza Bitcoin dza u rumela mbadelo. Nḓilani u ṱola hanefho hune tshelede na ḓiresi i ḓo ṱanganedzwa ngaho ni sa athu rumela tshelede.
```

```
        <source>Edit</source>
        <translation>Dzudzanya</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The correct translation for "Edit" in the context of Bitcoin should be "Dzudzanya" if referring to editing a setting or a transaction detail, but given the brevity of the word and context. It is better to use "Dzudzanya" which also means "Edit" in Shona language.
Dzudzanya
```

```
        <source>Export Address List</source>
        <translation>Mutevhe wa Ḓiresi dza u Rumela nnḓa</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The phrase "Mutevhe wa Ḓiresi dza u Rumela nnḓa" translates to "List of addresses for sending outside" which is not the correct translation for "Export Address List". The word "Mutevhe" means "list" but the rest of the phrase is not directly related to exporting an address list.

The correct translation should be something like: "U ṱaxisa Ḓiresi dza u Sendelwa", which means "To export addresses for sending".

NO
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>Ḓiresi dza u rumela - %1.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The phrase "Ḓiresi dza u rumela" translates to "Addresses for sending" which is not what the original text implies. The original text "Sending addresses - %1" implies that it is listing the addresses that are sending, not addresses for sending.

NO
```

```
        <source>Receiving addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>Ḓiresi dza u ṱanganedza - %1.</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses an incorrect word for "addresses" and includes an extra period at the end of the sentence. The correct translation should be: "Madirese a ho amohela - %1"
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>Ḓiresi</translation>
    
YES, The translation of "Address" to "Ḓiresi" is incorrect for Bitcoin terminology. In the context of Bitcoin, the term "address" refers to a string of alphanumeric characters that identifies a destination for Bitcoin transactions. The provided translation does not convey this meaning and is likely a mistranslation or an invented word.

Correct translation should be: Adres
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(a hu na lebula)</translation>
    
YES, The translation appears to be incorrect and possibly nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The phrase "(a hu na lebula)" does not seem to be a recognized or meaningful term in relation to Bitcoin addresses or labels.

Correct translation: (no label)
```

```

```
        <source>Repeat new passphrase</source>
        <translation>Dovholola ḽifurase ḽiswa</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "Dovholola" seems to be a mistranslation or a made-up word, and the subsequent words are also nonsensical in the context of repeating a passphrase. The intended meaning is to confirm a new password.

NO

        <source>Encrypt wallet</source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi tsha u ṅwalulula</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses the verb "to encrypt" instead of "to decrypt". The correct translation for "Encrypt wallet" is "Tshipatshi tsha u ṅwalisa".
```

        <translation>Naa ni na vhuṱanzi ha uri ni tama u ṅwalulula tshipatshi tshaṋu?</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The original English text asks if the user wishes to "encrypt" their wallet, but the translation uses the word "ṅwalulula" which means "to decrypt" or "to undo the writing." The correct translation should use a word related to encryption.

NO
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>

YES - The translation seems to be in a language that the system is not familiar with, as indicated by the presence of characters not typically found in standard alphabets. The translation also appears to be in a language the system is not trained on, hence the output UNK_LANG.

UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Ṅwalani ṱhalutshedzo ya kale na ṱhalutshedzo ntswa ya tshipatshi.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The 've' language appears to be Venda. The translation is not accurate. The word "Ṅwalani" means "write" not "enter". "ṱhalutshedzo" means "explanation" not "passphrase". "tshipatshi" means "ship" not "wallet".

Correct translation: Nwalani hafha lawudzo ya khale na lawudzo yone ya pholisi.
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi tshi do ṅwaliwa</translation>
    
YES
The translation is not accurate. The source text translates to "Wallet to be encrypted" in English, but the provided translation means "The wallet will be written." in Venda.

The correct translation should be: "Wallet to be encrypted" - "Tshipatshi tshi do vhonetshelwa"
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi tshanu tshi tsini na u ṅwaliwa.</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses a literal interpretation of "encrypted" as "written" which is not accurate in the context of Bitcoin wallets. The correct translation should convey the idea of the wallet being protected with a password or encryption.

Correct translation: Wallet ya hau i khou vhodo ṅwalelwa.
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is now encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi tshanu tsho no ṅwaliwa.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is grammatically incorrect and nonsensical in Venda. The phrase "Tshipatshi tshanu tsho no ṅwaliwa" does not convey the meaning of "Your wallet is now encrypted."

The correct translation should be: "Tholedu ya hau i ṅwaliweli.</translation>
```

```
        <source>IMPORTANT: Any previous backups you have made of your wallet file should be replaced with the newly generated, encrypted wallet file. For security reasons, previous backups of the unencrypted wallet file will become useless as soon as you start using the new, encrypted wallet.</source>

UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed</source>
        <translation>U ṅwalulula tshipatshi zwo kundelwa</translation>
    
YES, The translation incorrectly translates "encryption" as "decryption". The word "U ṅwalulula" means "to decrypt" or "to unscramble". The correct term for "encryption" would be "u livhumba" or "u ṅwala phasiwodo".

Correct translation:
U livhumba tshipatshi zwo kundelwa
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>U ṅwalulula tshipatshi zwo kundelwa nga mulandu wa vhukhakhi ha nga ngomu. Tshipatshi tshanu tsho vha tshi songo ṅwaliwa.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is problematic because the word "ṅwalulula" (which means "to uncover" or "to reveal") is used instead of a word that signifies encryption. The correct term for encryption in this context would be something like "ku ṅwalelwa" or "ku kaṅama".

Correct translation: U kaṅama tshipatshi zwo kundelwa nga mulandu wa vhukhakhi ha nga ngomu. Tshipatshi tshanu tsho vha tshi songo kaṅamwa.
```

```
        <source>Wallet unlock failed</source>
        <translation>U vula tshipatshi zwo kundelwa</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The original English phrase "Wallet unlock failed" translates to "U vula tshipatshi zwo kundelwa" in the Venda language. However, the correct translation should be "U vula/bula sanakudzi zwo kundelela". This is because "sanakudzi" is the Venda word for wallet, and "kundelela" means failed.

The correct translation is: U vula sanakudzi zwo kundelela
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>Phasiphrase yo dzheniswaho ya u bvisa tshipatshi yo vha yo khakhea.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses a language that is not English, and the prompt specifies the target language as 've'. The translated text seems to be in Tshivenḓa. The translation is: "The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect." This translation is accurate. However, since the target language is specified as 've' and the translation is in Tshivenḓa, it indicates a mismatch.

NO
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character.

YES, The translation is problematic because it is not in the 've' language. It appears to be in Venda. The correct translation in English is: "The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character. If this is successful, please set a new passphrase to avoid this issue in the future."

```
        <source>Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.</source>
        <translation>Phasiphrase ya tshipatshi yo shandukiswa nga nḓila yo bvelelaho.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses a gendered pronoun "yo" which is not appropriate for "Wallet passphrase". The correct translation should not include this pronoun.
Correct translation: Phasiphrase ya tshipatshi shandukiswa nga nḓila yo bvelelaho.
```

```
        <source>The old passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character.</source>
        <translation>Phasiphrase ya kale yo dzheniswaho ya u bvisa tshipatshi a yo ngo tea. I na tshiga tsha null (ndi uri - byte ya zero).

YES, The translation is problematic because the meaning of the original English text is not accurately conveyed in the translated text. The translated text uses terms that are not commonly understood in the context of Bitcoin and cryptography. Specifically, "tshipatshi" is not a standard term for a wallet, and "mubulo wa u dzhena" is an unclear translation for "passphrase."

Here is a more accurate translation:
"Phasiphrase ya khale ye ya shayelwaho u vula khamelo ya wolete ya beya yo sa tea. I na mushumo wa u vha nyana (mbalo ya zero). Arali phasiphrase yo vhewa nga vhudzulo ha mushumo une wa vha u si Athengedze 25.0, lingedzani hafhu nga maḽeḓere fhedzi u swika kha — fhedzi vha sa kateli — maḽeḓere a u thoma a si na mushumo."
```

```
        <source>Banned Until</source>
        <translation>Yo iledzwa u swika</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it uses a colloquialism ("Yo") that is not appropriate for the context of Bitcoin, which typically requires formal and precise language. The translation also appears to be in an unknown language.
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Runaway exception</source>
        <translation>U shavha nga nnḓa ha</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate and does not convey the intended meaning of "Runaway exception". The provided translation appears to be a literal and nonsensical interpretation in the target language.

Correct translation:  `Tshelede yo ḓiḓiwaho uri yo fhira` or `Tshelede yo fhira`
```

        <translation>Naa ni ṱoḓa u vhuedzedza zwishumiswa kha ndeme dza kale, kana u litsha ni sa iti tshanduko?</translation>
    
YES, The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning of the source text. The word "ṱoḓa" is not a standard word in Venda. The phrase "vhuedzedza zwishumiswa kha ndeme dza kale" seems to be a literal translation of "reset settings to default values" but it is not idiomatic. The phrase "u litsha ni sa iti tshanduko" translates to "to leave without making changes" which is understandable, but the overall sentence structure is awkward.

A more accurate and natural translation would be:

"Naa ni ṱoḓa u dzhenisa zwishumiswa kha ndeme dza kale, kana u litsha ni sa ite shanduko?"
```

```
        <source>A fatal error occurred. Check that settings file is writable, or try running with -nosettings.</source>
        <extracomment>Explanatory text shown on startup when the settings file could not be written. Prompts user to check that we have the ability to write to the file. Explains that the user has the option of running without a settings file.</extracomment>
        <translation>Ho itea vhukhakhi vhu vhulayaho. Sedzani uri faila ya zwishumiswa i a ṅwaliwa, kana ni lingedze u shuma na -nosettings.</translation>
    
YES. The translation contains an error. The word "vhulayaho" in the translation means "deadly" or "fatal" and is used correctly. However, the sentence "Ho itea vhukhakhi vhu vhulayaho" translates to "A fatal error has occurred" but the meaning is not clear.

A better translation would be:
"Ho si vhukori vhukalanga ha khou itea. Sedzani uri faila ya zwishumiswa i a ṅwaliwa, kana ni lingedze u shuma na -nosettings."

This translates to: "A critical error is occurring. Check that the settings file is writable, or try running with -nosettings."
```

```
        <source>Error: %1</source>
        <translation>Vhukhakhi: %1.</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses the wrong word for "Error". The word "Vhukhakhi" means "mistake" or "fault" in TshiVenda, but "Phoso" is a more direct and appropriate translation for "Error" in this context.
Phoso: %1.
```

```
        <source>%1 didn't yet exit safely…</source>
        <translation>%1 a i athu bva yo tsireledzea...</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. It appears to be a misunderstanding of the English sentence. The original sentence describes a process that has not yet completed safely. The translation uses a phrase that suggests a permanent state of being unsafe.

A more accurate translation would be:

NO
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi:</translation>
    
YES, The provided translation for "Wallet" to "Tshipatshi" is incorrect in the context of Bitcoin. In many African languages, "wallet" is often translated using terms that are closer to "mfuko" or "pochi."
The correct translation for "Wallet" in this context should be "Mfuko."

YES, The translation incorrectly uses "yo tendelwa" which is a literal translation of "is enabled" and does not convey the intended meaning accurately in the context of Bitcoin. The correct translation should reflect that the proxy is activated or functioning. The word "proxy" itself might also need a more contextually appropriate translation depending on the exact nuance, but for a direct enablement statement, a verb indicating activation is better.

Correct translation: Proxy is enabled: %1

        <source>Receive</source>
        <translation>Ṱanganedza</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because "Ṱanganedza" is not a valid word in any known language. The correct translation for "Receive" in the context of Bitcoin would depend on the specific language represented by 've', which is not identifiable. Assuming 've' refers to a language where the concept of receiving is used in a Bitcoin context, a placeholder translation would be needed. However, without knowing the target language, a precise correction is impossible. If 've' is meant to be Shona (which uses the character 'ṱ'), the word for "receive" is "Gamuchira".

NO
```

```
        <source>Encrypt Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Kha vha ṅwale Tshipatshi...</translation>

        <translation>Kha vha ṅwalulule khii dza phuraivethe dzine dza vha dza tshipatshi tshavho</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because the word "phuraivethe" is not a standard or recognized word in Venda. It appears to be a misspelling or an attempt to translate "private" that did not result in a correct Venda word. The correct word for "private" in this context would be "kha ṅwalululela" or "phurinase".

YES, the translation contains a word that is not in the Venda language. The word "milaedza" is not a Venda word. The correct translation should be "melaedza" which means messages.

YES
The 've' language is not a recognized language. The translation contains 'ubva kha faila' which does not appear to be a valid translation of "from file". Assuming the target language is supposed to be "vi" (Vietnamese), a correct translation would be "Tải PSBT từ tệp...".

        <translation>Kha vha sike Tshipatshi...</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The source text "Create Wallet…" translates to "Kha vha sike Tshipatshi..." which means "Do not break the wallet...". A correct translation would be "Duvhedzani Tshipatshi...".

NO

```
        <source>Close All Wallets…</source>
        <translation>Vhalani zwipatshi zwothe...</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The term "Vhalani" in the translation means "Read" or "Check", which does not accurately convey the meaning of "Close" in the context of wallets. Additionally, "zwipatshi" which translates to "things" or "items" is not the correct term for "wallets".

The correct translation for "Close All Wallets…" should be something that conveys the action of closing all the wallets. A more accurate translation would be:

"Vhalani zwifhafu zwothe..." or "Vhalani zwikhutshi zwothe..."

Here's a breakdown:

*   **"Close"**: The concept of "closing" in the context of software or applications usually translates to terms like "Vhalani" (which can mean to finish or conclude an action in some contexts, though "khupha" or "tsema" can also be used depending on nuance), or more directly "tsema" (to close or shut). "Vhalani" here can be interpreted as finishing or concluding the operation of the wallets.
*   **"All"**: "Zwothe" correctly translates to "all".
*   **"Wallets"**: "Zwifhafu" or "Zikhutshi" are better approximations for "wallets" in this context than "zwipatshi". "Zwifhafu" can refer to a place where things are kept, like a purse or a wallet. "Zikhutshi" also can be understood in a similar sense.

Considering the context of closing, "Vhalani zwifhafu zwothe..." or "Vhalani zwikhutshi zwothe..." would be more appropriate. However, if the intention is a more direct "shutting down" action, a different phrasing might be needed. Given the ambiguity of "Vhalani" in this specific context, and the incorrect word for wallets, the translation is problematic.

Let's refine the translation to be more direct about the "closing" action:

Correct Translation: **Vhalani zwikhutshi zwothe...** or **Tsema zwikhutshi zwothe...**

Given the context of Bitcoin wallets, a term that implies shutting down or closing operations would be ideal. "Vhalani" can sometimes imply finishing a process. If we want to be more explicit about "closing" as in shutting down, "Tsema" is a better choice.

**Revised Problematic Assessment:**

YES, the translation is problematic.
Explanation: The word "Vhalani" (meaning "Read" or "Check") and "zwipatshi" (meaning "things" or "items") are inaccurate for "Close All Wallets".
Correct translation: **Tsema zwikhutshi zwothe...**

"Tshivhambadzwaseli" is a word from the Venda language which means "exporter" (a person or entity that exports) rather than the act or function of exporting. The correct translation for "Export" as a verb or noun referring to the action of exporting data or files is "Bhuritsa" or "Ngozha".

NO, The translation is unproblematic.
