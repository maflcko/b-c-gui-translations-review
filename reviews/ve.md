```
        <source>Right-click to edit address or label</source>
        <translation>Kha vha puṱedze nga tsha u ḽa u itela u shandula ḓiresi kana ḽebuḽu</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains extra whitespace before "ḽa" ("nga tsha u ḽa u itela") which should be condensed. Also, "puṱedze" means "press" or "push," but "Right-click" specifically refers to using the right mouse button, which may be better rendered explicitly if possible. However, since precise computer terminology in Tshivenda might be limited, keeping "Right-click" as "Kha vha puṱedze nga tsha u ḽa" is acceptable if "ḽa" denotes "right" or "right side."

A cleaner and more concise translation would be:  
**"Kha vha puṱedze tsha u ḽa u itela u shandula ḓiresi kana ḽebelu"**

Note the removal of the extra space before "ḽa" and correction of "ḽebuḽu" to "ḽebelu," reflecting the correct form for "label."
```

```
        <source>Export</source>
        <translation>Tshivhambadzwaseli</translation>
    
YES  
The language code 've' corresponds to Venda. The translation "Tshivhambadzwaseli" is incorrect for the English word "Export." The correct Venda translation for "Export" is "Tshivhumbadzaho" or "Tshivhumbadzwa" depending on context.  
Correct translation: Tshivhumbadzaho
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>Thutha</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Thutha" in Tshivenḓa (language code 've') means "move" or "transfer," not "delete." The correct translation for "Delete" in Tshivenḓa is "Vhula."  

Correct translation:  
<Vhula>
```

```
        <source>Choose the address to receive coins with</source>
        <translation>Khethani ḓiresi ine na ḓo ṱanganedza ngayo tshelede ya tsimbi nga .</translation>
    
YES
The translation ends with a stray period preceded by a space (" nga ."), which is a formatting error. Also, the structure is slightly awkward and may be improved for clarity.

Correct translation:
Khethani ḓiresi ine na ḓo ṱanganedza ngayo tshelede ya tsimbi nga.
```

```
        <source>Export Address List</source>
        <translation>Mutevhe wa Ḓiresi dza u Rumela nnḓa</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Mutevhe wa Ḓiresi dza u Rumela nnḓa" is not an accurate rendering of "Export Address List" in the Venda (ve) language. Specifically:  
- "Mutevhe" means "folder" or "file" rather than "export."  
- "wa Ḓiresi" is a phonetic form of "of address," which is acceptable.  
- "dza u Rumela" is unclear and likely incorrect; "rumela" means "send" or "deliver," but the verbal noun is typically formed differently.  
- "nnḓa" means "inside," which does not fit the intended meaning.

A more accurate translation for "Export Address List" in Venda would be:  
**"Lwendo lwa Ṱhaluso dza Ḓiresi"** (List of Addresses to Export) or  
**"U Ṱhavhanya Bugu ya Ḓiresi"** (To export the address book/list).

Alternatively, a direct and clear translation:  
**"Exporta Lwendo lwa Ḓiresi"** (Export Address List), where "Exporta" is adapted from English but commonly understood.

Correct translation suggestion:  
<translation>Exporta Lwendo lwa Ḓiresi</translation>
```

```
        <source>Sending addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>Ḓiresi dza u rumela - %1.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a trailing period (.) that does not exist in the source text, which is a formatting inconsistency. Also, the translation "Ḓiresi dza u rumela" literally means "addresses for sending," which is acceptable, but the use of "dza u" might be better as "dza u rumela" only if fully consistent with standard phrasing in 've' (Venda). However, the main issue is the extraneous period at the end.

Correct translation:  
Ḓiresi dza u rumela - %1
```

```
        <source>Receiving addresses - %1</source>
        <translation>Ḓiresi dza u ṱanganedza - %1.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation incorrectly adds a period at the end which is not present in the source and is unnecessary. Also, the phrase should not have extra spacing around the hyphen. The format specifier %1 is correctly copied.

Correct translation:  
Ḓiresi dza u ṱanganedza - %1
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>Ḓiresi</translation>
    
YES  
The provided translation "Ḓiresi" is incorrect for the language code 've' (Venda). The correct translation for "Address" in Venda is "Aderesi".  

Correct translation:  
Aderesi
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(a hu na lebula)</translation>
    
YES
The translation "(a hu na lebula)" does not accurately reflect the English source "(no label)". The phrase should convey the absence of a label, typically meaning "no label" or "without label". 

A more accurate translation in Venda ('ve') would be:
(no label)
=>(haa na tshifanyiso) or simply (haa na lebitso)

Correct translation:
(haa na lebitso)
```

```
        <source>Enter passphrase</source>
        <translation>Ṅwalani ḽifurase</translation>
    
YES  
The translation uses "ḽifurase" which appears to be a loanword or incorrect representation for "passphrase." In Tshivenda (language code 've'), "passphrase" can be translated more accurately as "ṱhafho ya phaṱhutshedzo" (security phrase) or simply "phasi ya u fhindula."  

Correct translation:  
Ṅwalani ṱhafho ya phaṱhutshedzo
```

```
        <source>Encrypt wallet</source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi tsha u ṅwalulula</translation>
    
YES  
The provided translation "Tshipatshi tsha u ṅwalulula" appears to contain an error in word choice or form. The English phrase "Encrypt wallet" is an imperative or action phrase instructing to encrypt the wallet. The word "Ṅwalulula" seems unrelated; in Tshivenda, "Ṅwalulwa" means "be written" or "written," but "Ṅwalulula" is not a standard form and may be incorrect.

A better translation for "Encrypt wallet" in Tshivenda would be:  
"Tshipatshi tsha u vhulunga kha wallet"  
where "vhulunga" means "to encrypt" or "to lock," and "kha wallet" specifies the wallet. Alternatively, if a localized term for "wallet" is known, it can be used instead.

Correct translation:  
Tshipatshi tsha u vhulunga kha wallet
```

```
        <source>Confirm wallet encryption</source>
        <translation>Kha vha khwaṱhisedze u ṅwalulula tshipatshi</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains an incorrect term "u ṅwalulula tshipatshi" which does not accurately convey "encryption". The word "encryption" should be translated as something like "u fambela nga ndila ya u vhuya" or a more accurate term in the Venda language relating to secure encryption, but the provided phrase appears to mean "to write/process a letter" or similar, which is incorrect.

A better translation could be:  
Kha vha khwaṱhisedze u vhona u ṅwalisela ha wallet  

(Note: "wallet" is often kept in English or adapted as "wallet" due to technical context, or as "khwama ya mbalo" if fully translated.)
```

```
        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Tsevho: Arali na ṅwalulula tshipatshi tshaṋu nahone na xelelwa nga passphrase yaṋu, ni ḓo XELELA BITCOIN DZANU DZOṰHE!</translation>

```

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?</source>
        <translation>Naa ni na vhuṱanzi ha uri ni tama u ṅwalulula tshipatshi tshaṋu?</translation>
    
YES  
The language code "ve" refers to Tshivenda (Venda). The translation is mostly accurate but contains a minor issue with the verb "u ṅwalulula," which means "to write" or "to record," rather than "to encrypt." A better verb to use for "encrypt" in Tshivenda would be "u luvha" or "u shumisa tshanduko ya u vhidza" (to use encryption/modification to hide). The phrasing "tshipatshi tshaṋu" correctly means "your wallet." Also, the question construction "Naa ni na vhuṱanzi ha uri…" is correct for "Are you sure that…".

Correct translation:  
Naa ni na vhukoni ha u ṅwalela tshipatshi tshaṋu?  

(Note: "u ṅwalela" can be a neologism adapted as "to encrypt" or "to code"; if no established word exists, "u luvha" might be used for encryption. The main issue is that "u ṅwalulula" is not correct as it means "to write down," not encrypt.)
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>

YES
The translation is incomplete and omits important formatting and detail from the source. The source specifies the requirement for the passphrase as "<b>ten or more random characters</b>" and "<b>eight or more words</b>" with HTML tags and emphasis, which are missing in the translation. Also, the line break "<br/>" is not preserved.

Correct translation suggestion preserving formatting and content:

Ṅwalani ḽifurase ḽiswa ḽa tshipatshi.&lt;br/&gt;Kha vha shumise ḽifurase ḽa maḽeḓere a &lt;b&gt;fumi kana u fhira kha u sumbedza nga u bva kha nnḓa&lt;/b&gt;, kana &lt;b&gt;maipfi a fhira tshikololo tsha nṋa&lt;/b&gt;.

(Note: The exact wording may vary depending on dialect and vocabulary availability, but the key points are preserving the line break, the emphasis tags, and specifying "ten or more random characters" and "eight or more words.")

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi tshi do ṅwaliwa</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Tshipatshi tshi do ṅwaliwa" contains an error with the word "do," which is not appropriate in this context and breaks the intended meaning. A more accurate translation for "Wallet to be encrypted" in Tshivenda should correctly convey that the wallet is the object to be encrypted, without extra pronouns or auxiliary verbs.  

Correct translation:  
Tshipatshi tshi khou ṅwalwa (meaning "Wallet being encrypted" or "Wallet to be encrypted")
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi tshanu tshi tsini na u ṅwaliwa.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains unnecessary trailing whitespace after the English source text, which is not carried over in the translation, potentially causing formatting inconsistency. Additionally, the phrase should be clear and coherent in Tshivenda (language code 've'). The translated sentence "Tshipatshi tshanu tshi tsini na u ṅwaliwa." roughly means "Your wallet is near to being written/encrypted," which is acceptable but could be more naturally phrased.

Correct translation:  
Tshipatshi tshanu tshi kha ḓo vha tshine tsha ṅwaliwa.
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is now encrypted. </source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi tshanu tsho no ṅwaliwa.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a trailing space in the source after the period ("encrypted. "), but the translation does not include any trailing space, which is acceptable. However, the translation itself seems awkward and may not accurately convey "Your wallet is now encrypted." The word "tshipatshi" could mean "wallet" in Tshivenda ('ve'), but "tshanu tsho no ṅwaliwa" appears to be incorrect or unnatural for "is now encrypted." The verb "ṅwaliwa" may relate to "writing" rather than "encrypting."  

A more accurate translation would be:  
**"Tshipatshi tshanu tshi khou ṅwaliwa zwavhuḓi."**  
This means "Your wallet is now properly encrypted" (using 'ṅwaliwa' appropriately in passive voice or better phrasing indicating encryption). Alternatively, a simpler version without the trailing space in the source could be:  
**"Tshipatshi tshanu tshi ṅwaliwa zwavhuḓi."**  

If the translator wants to strictly mirror "now encrypted," "tshi tshi khou ṅwaliwa" could represent "is now encrypted."  

Summary: The current translation is awkward and possibly incorrect in meaning. It should be corrected as shown above.
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>U ṅwalulula tshipatshi zwo kundelwa nga mulandu wa vhukhakhi ha nga ngomu. Tshipatshi tshanu tsho vha tshi songo ṅwaliwa.</translation>
    
UNK_LANG, not familiar with the language 've' (Tshivenda).
```

```
        <source>Wallet unlock failed</source>
        <translation>U vula tshipatshi zwo kundelwa</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "U vula tshipatshi zwo kundelwa" is incorrect and does not accurately convey "Wallet unlock failed" in Tshivenda (language code 've'). The phrase should clearly state that the unlocking of the wallet was unsuccessful.  

Correct translation:  
"U bviswa ha wallet wo faileda"  
or more naturally:  
"U bviswa ha wallet ha pfumela"  
("Unlocking of wallet failed" / "Wallet unlocking did not succeed")
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>Phasiphrase yo dzheniswaho ya u bvisa tshipatshi yo vha yo khakhea.</translation>
    
UNK_LANG, not familiar with the language 've'.
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character. If this is successful, please set a new passphrase to avoid this issue in the future.</source>
        <translation>Phasiphrase yo dzheniswaho ya u bvisa tshipatshi a yo ngo tea. I na tshiga tsha null (ndi uri - byte ya zero). Arali mubulo wa u dzhena wo vhewa na mbekanyamushumo ya sofuthiwee iyi phanḓa ha 25.0, kha vha lingedze hafhu nga maḽeḓere fhedzi u swika kha — fhedzi vha sa kateli — maḽeḓere a u thoma a si na mushumo. Arali zwo bvelela, kha vha vhee passphrase ntswa u itela u iledza thaidzo iyi tshifhingani tshi ḓaho.</translation>
    
YES
The phrase "Phasiphrase yo dzheniswaho ya u bvisa tshipatshi" improperly translates "passphrase entered for the wallet decryption" and includes errors such as "ngo tea" instead of "ngo tea" (should probably be "ngo tea" or "ngo tea" is unclear), and "null character" is explained but lacks clarity in the target language. Also, there is inconsistent spacing around dashes "—" and phrase constructions are awkward.

Additionally, the English source uses "passphrase" throughout, while the translation switches between "Phasiphrase" and "passphrase" without consistent capitalization or localization.

A better translation in Tshivenda ('ve') should preserve the formatting of technical terms and maintain clarity, for example:

Phasiphrase yo dzheniswaho ya u bvisa tshipatshi (wallet) i nga ha nḓilani a yo amliwa nga hani. I na tshiga tsha null (zwine zwa humbula zwi tshi nga vha byte ya zero). Arali phasiphrase yo vha yo thomiwa nga tshitshavha tsha software tsha mboṱi ya 25.0 kana u thoma, tshi lingedze u dzhena nga maḽeḓere o swikaho — fhedzi hu sa katelwe — maḽeḓere a u thoma ane a si na tshiga tsha null. Arali zwi shumaho,ṱhe vha sumbedze phasiphrase ntswa u thama u dzhenisa mikhwa ya mulandu kha tshifhinga tshi ḓaho.

Corrected translation (formatted special characters and spacing cautiously):

<translation>Phasiphrase yo dzheniswaho ya u bvisa tshipatshi (wallet) i si yo amliwa nga hani. I na tshiga tsha null (ari - byte ya zero). Arali phasiphrase yo vha yo thomiwa nga tshitshavha tsha software tsha mboṱi ya 25.0, lingedza u dzhena nga maḽeḓere o swikaho — fhedzi hu sa katelwe — maḽeḓere a u thoma a si na tshiga tsha null. Arali zwi khwine, vha sumbedze phasiphrase ntswa u itela u dzula vhukuma khwine kha tshifhinga tshi ḓaho.</translation>

This version keeps special characters, format, and spacing proper and clarifies meaning.

```
        <source>Banned Until</source>
        <translation>Yo iledzwa u swika</translation>
    
YES  
The translation provided for 'Banned Until' seems to convey the idea "Banned until" or "Prohibited until" but is not a direct or fully clear translation in Venda ('ve'). The phrase "Yo iledzwa u swika" literally means "That is forbidden until" but is somewhat awkward and incomplete in common Venda usage. A more natural and correct translation would be:

**"U thivhelwa u swika"**

This uses "U thivhelwa" meaning "being banned" or "being prohibited," followed by "u swika" meaning "until." It aligns better with standard phrasing for "Banned Until" in Venda.

Hence the corrected translation is:  
<translation>U thivhelwa u swika</translation>
```

```
        <source>Runaway exception</source>
        <translation>U shavha nga nnḓa ha</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "U shavha nga nnḓa ha" does not correctly convey the meaning of "Runaway exception." The phrase "runaway exception" in programming contexts means an exception that was not caught or handled properly, and there is no direct idiomatic expression that matches this meaning in Venda ('ve'). A better and clearer translation would be:

"Ph****uthelo ya u fhedza nga u tou thoma"  

However, since there is no exact single-word equivalent, a phrase that explains it can be used, for example:

"Ph****uthelo kha tshifhinga tsha u tshila nga khombo"  

(meaning something like "an exception that happened unexpectedly")

Since this is quite technical, often the English term "runaway exception" might be used as is, or alternatively:

"Ph****uthelo yo vha yo no tou thoma"  

which means "an exception that started running away."

Note: The word "exception" is often kept as "exception" or "phuthelo" in Venda technical terms.

Therefore, a more contextually accurate translation would be:

"Phuthelo i tshiḽa u fhira teng"

(meaning "exception that runs beyond limits")

Because of lack of a direct standard term, the current translation is misleading and not accurate.

Correct translation suggestion:

"Phuthelo i tshiḽa u fhira teng"
```

```
        <source>Error: %1</source>
        <translation>Vhukhakhi: %1.</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Vhukhakhi" is incorrect for "Error" in Venda. The correct term for "Error" in Venda is "Mavhuyu" or "Phoso".

Correct translation:
Mavhuyu: %1
```

```
        <source>%1 didn't yet exit safely…</source>
        <translation>%1 a i athu bva yo tsireledzea...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a formatting issue: the ellipsis in the source "…" is represented by three periods "..." in the translation. If the original uses a single Unicode ellipsis character, the translation should mirror that for consistency. Also, there is no indication that the phrase is correctly translated for meaning, since "ve" is the language code for Venda, a South African language. The phrase "%1 didn't yet exit safely…" suggests a message about an unsafe exit.

Correct translation in Venda (approximate):  
%1 a si tsha fhelelaho nga u tsireledzwa…  

(Note: The ellipsis is the single character U+2026.)
```

```
        <source>Quit application</source>
        <translation>Litshani khumbelo</translation>
    
YES  
The language code 've' corresponds to Venda, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa. The provided translation "Litshani khumbelo" is incorrect.  

Explanation:  
- "Litshani" means "plant" or "put" (imperative form of 'to plant/put')  
- "khumbelo" means "request" or "petition"  
Together, "Litshani khumbelo" roughly translates as "Place the request," which does not convey the meaning "Quit application."  

Correct translation:  
"Vhumbela khumbelo" or simply "Vhumbela" meaning "Quit/Exit application" would be better. However, the verb "to quit" or "to exit" can be translated as "vhaela" (leave, go away, quit).  

A more appropriate phrase for "Quit application" in Venda might be:  
**"Vhaela khumbelo"**  
which literally means "Exit application."  

Hence:  
Correct translation:  
<translation>Vhaela khumbelo</translation>
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Tshipatshi:" is incorrect for "Wallet:" in Venda. The correct translation for "Wallet" in Venda is "Phatsho". 

Correct translation:
<translation>Phatsho:</translation>
```

```
        <source>Proxy is &lt;b&gt;enabled&lt;/b&gt;: %1</source>
        <translation>Proxy yo tendelwa: %1.</translation>
    
YES
The translation omits the formatting tags (&lt;b&gt;enabled&lt;/b&gt;) and does not convey the emphasis indicated by "enabled" being in bold. Also, the translation "Proxy yo tendelwa" appears to be incorrect or non-standard in Tshivenda ('ve'). A better translation maintaining the format and meaning would be:

Proxy yo &lt;b&gt;khwinwa&lt;/b&gt;: %1
```

```
        <source>Backup wallet to another location</source>
        <translation>Backup wallet kha inwe fhethu</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Backup wallet kha inwe fhethu" mixes English ("Backup wallet") with the target language "ve" (likely Tshivenda). The phrase should be fully translated. Also, "to another location" is translated properly as "kha inwe fhethu" ("to another place"). The term "wallet" should ideally be translated or at least localized if there is a known word. If no appropriate word exists, a localized term or transliteration can be used consistently.

A better translation would be:  
**"Luvhimisa tshikweleti kha inwe fhethu"**  
("Luvhimisa" means "backup/save", "tshikweleti" means "wallet", "kha inwe fhethu" means "to another place/location").  

If "wallet" is kept in English due to lack of a better term, the rest should be in Tshivenda, e.g.:  
**"Tshimbidza wallet kha inwe fhethu"** (meaning "backup/save wallet to another place").  

But full loanwords mixed with native language is not ideal. So the above correction is preferred.

        <translation>Shandukisani ḽifurase ḽo shumiswaho kha u ṅwalulula tshipatshi</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains spacing inconsistencies before the prepositions "kha" and "u". Also, "tshipatshi" (wallet) seems correctly used but "ṋwalulula" (to encrypt/write) may not precisely convey "encryption" in this context. A more accurate phrase might use a clearer term for "encryption."

Correct translation:

        <source>Receive</source>
        <translation>Ṱanganedza</translation>
    
YES  
The language code 've' corresponds to Venda (Tshivenda). The English word "Receive" translates to "Dzula u wana" or more simply "Amba" depending on context, but "Ṱanganedza" means "to negotiate" or "mediate," which is not correct for "Receive."  

Correct translation:  
<translation>Dzhia</translation>  
("Dzhia" means "Receive" in Venda.)
```

```
        <source>Encrypt Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Kha vha ṅwale Tshipatshi...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation for "Encrypt Wallet…" should use an ellipsis character (…) instead of three dots (...). Also, "Wallet" should correspond to the appropriate term in 've' (Tshivenda). "Tshipatshi" means "wallet," which is correct. The verb "Kha vha ṅwale" means "Let them write" which is incorrect for "Encrypt." The correct verb for encrypt in Tshivenda is close to "Vhala nga u vhara" or "Vhala nga u khou vhala" but for a software context, it can be simplified as "Vhala" or "Vhala nga u ṅwala," implying "to encrypt."

Correct translation:  
Kha vha vhalwe Tshipatshi…
```

```
        <source>Encrypt the private keys that belong to your wallet</source>
        <translation>Kha vha ṅwalulule khii dza phuraivethe dzine dza vha dza tshipatshi tshavho</translation>
    
YES  
The translation uses "kha vha ṅwalulule" which suggests "encrypt," but the phrase is somewhat awkward and incomplete, lacking a clear verb-object structure for "the private keys that belong to your wallet." The word "phuraivethe" is a transliteration of "private," which may be acceptable but could be better localized. Also, "tsavho" is used for "your," but the possessive construction can be improved for clarity.

A more accurate and clearer translation in Tshivenda ('ve') would be:  
**"Kha vha leumberelule khii dza muhumbulo dzi dzo vhaḓa tshitshavha tshaṋu"**  

Which translates back as: "Encrypt the private keys that belong to your wallet," with proper possessive and clearer structure.

```
        <source>Backup Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Tshipatshi tsha u vhulunga...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation for "Backup Wallet…" should use an ellipsis character (…) rather than three periods (...). The English source uses a single ellipsis character after "Backup Wallet". Also, verify that the spacing around the ellipsis is consistent. The current translation uses three periods without the ellipsis character.

Correct translation:  
Tshipatshi tsha u vhulunga…
```

```
        <source>Change Passphrase…</source>
        <translation>Shandukisa Mubulo wa Phasi...</translation>
    
YES
The ellipsis character in the source is the Unicode single character "…" U+2026, but the translation uses three periods "...". It is preferable to use the proper ellipsis character to match the source punctuation. Also, the translation should ensure there's no extra spacing issues.

Suggested correction:
Shandukisa Mubulo wa Phasi…
```

```
        <source>Sign message…</source>
        <translation>Saina mulaedza...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Saina mulaedza..." is incorrect. The English "Sign message…" implies an action to digitally sign a message in the Bitcoin context. The given translation does not correctly convey this meaning in Venda ('ve').  

Correct translation:  
"Saina metha..."  

Explanation:  
- "Saina" is a transliteration of "sign".  
- "metha" means "message" in Venda.  
- The ellipsis "…" is correctly used at the end without extra spaces.

```
        <source>Load PSBT from file…</source>
        <translation>Load PSBT ubva kha faila...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic because it partially uses English ("Load PSBT") instead of fully translating the phrase. Also, the ellipsis character in the source is a single Unicode character (…) but the translation uses three periods (...). Additionally, the language code 've' refers to Venda, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa.

A more appropriate and fully translated version, following Venda grammar and vocabulary, would be:  
"Thomiša PSBT u bva kha faila…"  

Notes:  
- "Thomiša" means "load" or "start/load up" in Venda.  
- "ubva" is not correct; "u bva" means "from," which is correct but the verb should be in the imperative or indicative form matching context. "Thomiša" is commonly used for "load."  
- "file" is often used as "faila" in loanword form.  
- The ellipsis should be the single character "…" matching the source.

Correct translation:  
<translation>Thomiša PSBT u bva kha faila…</translation>
```

```
        <source>Close Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Vhalani Tshipatshi...</translation>
    
YES
The ellipsis character in the source is the Unicode single character "…", but the translation uses three separate periods "...". For consistency and correctness, the ellipsis should be a single character "…".

Correct translation:
Vhalani Tshipatshi…
```

```
        <source>Create Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Kha vha sike Tshipatshi...</translation>
    
YES
The ellipsis character in the source is a single Unicode ellipsis (…) and should be preserved exactly. The translation uses three periods (...) instead, which is not consistent with the source format.

Correct translation:
Kha vha sike Tshipatshi…
```

```
        <source>Close All Wallets…</source>
        <translation>Vhalani zwipatshi zwothe...</translation>
    
YES  
The ellipsis character in the source is the single character "…", but the translation uses three dots "...". The use of three dots is not necessarily wrong, but for consistency and correctness, it should match the source character.   
Correct translation:  
Vhalani zwipatshi zwothe…
```

```
        <source>Tabs toolbar</source>
        <translation>Bara ya zwishumiswa zwa thebu</translation>
    
YES  
The language code 've' corresponds to Tshivenda, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa. The provided translation "Bara ya zwishumiswa zwa thebu" literally means "Bar of the tools of the table," which is a somewhat literal but awkward and uncommon phrasing for "Tabs toolbar." The English term "Tabs toolbar" refers to the toolbar that contains tabs, often translated more naturally by focusing on the concept of a toolbar with tabs or a toolbar for switching views.

A more natural and accurate Tshivenda translation would be:  
"Bara ya zwizwiliso zwa thebu"  
("Bar of the tabs of the table") or  
"Bara ya zwikala zwa thebu"  
("Bar of the tabs of the table")  

But since "tab" is a modern computing term with no exact indigenous equivalent, it is often borrowed as "tabu" or explained descriptively.

Therefore, a better option:  
"Bara ya ma tabo a thebhu"  
("Bar of the tabs of the table")  

If borrowing the English loanword "tab" is acceptable, "tabo" or "tabhu" can be used.

Corrected translation:  
<translation>Bara ya ma tabo a thebhu</translation>
```

        <source>Syncing Headers (%1%)…</source>
        <translation>109
U ṱanganya ṱhoho (%1%)...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a stray "109" at the beginning, which is erroneous and not present in the source. Also, the ellipsis "…" in the source should match the style in the translation. The phrase "U ṱanganya ṱhoho (%1%)..." is mostly correct for "Syncing Headers (%1%)…", but the leading number must be removed.

Correct translation:  
U ṱanganya ṱhoho (%1%)…
```

```
        <source>Synchronizing with network…</source>
        <translation>U ṱanganya na nethiweke...</translation>
    
YES
The ellipsis in the source is a single Unicode ellipsis character (U+2026), but in the translation, it is represented by three periods "...". For correct formatting and consistency, the translation should use the single ellipsis character.

Correct translation:
U ṱanganya na nethiweke…

        <translation>Humbelani mbadelo (u bveledza khoudu dza QR na bitcoin: URI)</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a typo: "mbadelo" should be "mbadela" for "payments" in Venda. Also, "URI" should be pluralized to "URI" or "URI's" depending on common usage, but keeping it as "URI" is acceptable if it's considered an acronym. The word "khoudu" is a phonetic rendering of "code" and is acceptable. The verb "u bveledza" correctly means "generates."

Correct translation:  
Humbelani mbadela (u bveledza khoudu dza QR na bitcoin: URI)

The translation "(a hu na lebula)" does not accurately reflect the English source "(no label)". The phrase should convey the absence of a label, typically meaning "no label" or "without label". 

A more accurate translation in Venda ('ve') would be:
