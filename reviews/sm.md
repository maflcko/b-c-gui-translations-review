        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia le Fa'atauina</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Fa'amaonia le Fa'atauina" means "Confirming the purchase" in Samoan, which is incorrect for the English source "Exporting Failed". The correct translation should convey that the export operation did not succeed.

A more accurate translation would be:
"Ua le manuia le Fa'auina"  
or  
"Ua fa'aletonu le Fa'auina"

where "Fa'auina" refers to exporting or sending data, and "le manuia" or "fa'aletonu" indicates failure.
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(leai se fa'amaoniga)</translation>
    
YES  
The original English phrase "(no label)" indicates that there is no label assigned. The Samoan translation "(leai se fa'amaoniga)" means "(no confirmation)" rather than "(no label)". The correct translation for "(no label)" in Samoan should be "(leai se igoa)" or "(leai se lipine)" depending on context, but "(leai se igoa)" is more appropriate for "label" in UI contexts.

Correct translation:  
(leai se igoa)
```

```
        <source>New passphrase</source>
        <translation>Fesili fou</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Fesili fou" means "New question" in Samoan, which is incorrect. The correct translation for "New passphrase" should be "Upu faʻamau fou".
```

```
        <source>This operation needs your wallet passphrase to unlock the wallet.</source>
        <translation>E manaʻomia le fa'amaoniga o lau fa'amaoniga o le pusa i totonu o le taga e fa'asa'o ai le pusa.</translation>

        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaoniga: Afai e te fa'amaonia lau 'aofa'i ma le leiloa o lau fa'amaoniga, o le a &lt;b&gt;Losi uma au Bitcoinsi&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?</source>
        <translation>Ua e mautinoa o le fiafia e fa'amaonia lau 'au'aunaga?</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of encrypting a wallet. It translates roughly as "Are you sure you are happy to confirm your service?" which is unrelated to the original message about wallet encryption.

Correct translation:  
Ua e mautinoa o loʻo e manaʻomia le faʻailogaina o lau atotupe?
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>
        <translation>Tu'u i totonu le fa'amaoniga fou mo le taga.&lt;br/&gt;Fa'amolemole fa'aaoga se passphrase o &lt;b&gt;Sefulu poʻo le tele o le pisinisi faʻavaomalo&lt;/b&gt;, po o &lt;b&gt;Valo poʻo si'umea upu&lt;/b&gt;.</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains errors and unnatural phrasing. Specifically:
- "fa'amaoniga" (verification) is incorrect for "passphrase"; it should be "faʻaupuga" or "upu faʻapotopoto" which convey "passphrase" or "password."
- "taga" means "bag," but here it should be "pusa tupe (wallet)."
- "Sefulu poʻo le tele o le pisinisi faʻavaomalo" incorrectly translates to "ten or more international business," which is unrelated. It should convey "ten or more random characters."
- "Valo poʻo si'umea upu" is incorrect and nonsensical; it should mean "eight or more words."
- The English formatting tags like &lt;br/&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are correctly preserved but some spacing could be improved.

Correct translation:
Tu'u le faʻaupuga fou mo le atotupe.&lt;br/&gt;Fa'amolemole fa'aaoga se faʻaupuga o le &lt;b&gt;sefulu pe sili atu upu le iloa&lt;/b&gt;, po'o le &lt;b&gt;valu pe sili atu upu&lt;/b&gt;.

Note: "sili atu" = or more, "upu le iloa" = random characters (or the closest equivalent). Alternatively, the literal “characters” might be “mataʻitusi.” A better refined version:

Tu'u le faʻaupuga fou mo le atotupe.&lt;br/&gt;Fa'amolemole fa'aaoga se faʻaupuga o le &lt;b&gt;sefulu pe sili atu mataʻitusi le mafaitaulia&lt;/b&gt;, po'o le &lt;b&gt;valu pe sili atu upu&lt;/b&gt;.
```

```
        <source>Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Tu'uina le passphrase tuai ma le passphrase fou mo le 'wallet'.</translation>
    
YES
The translation mixes English and Samoan by leaving "passphrase" and "wallet" in English without localization or clear indication of loanwords, which may be acceptable but inconsistent. Also, quotation marks around 'wallet' are unnecessary and uncommon in Samoan translations. A more natural translation would fully integrate or italicize technical terms without quotation marks.

Correct translation:
Tu'uina le upu fa'apuipui tuai ma le upu fa'apuipui fou mo le atotupe.
```

```
        <source>Remember that encrypting your wallet cannot fully protect your bitcoins from being stolen by malware infecting your computer.</source>
        <translation>Manatua o le fa'amaonia o lau atigipusa e le mafai ona puipuia lelei lau bitcoins mai le fa'ama'i o malware o lo'o fa'ama'i i lau komepiuta.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has problematic wording and inaccuracies:  
- "fa'amaonia" means "to confirm" rather than "encrypt". A better word for "encrypt" would be "fa'amaufaʻailoga" or "fa'ašele."  
- The phrase "fa'ama'i o malware" incorrectly translates "malware infection" literally; it should rather be phrased as "malware o lo'o osofaʻia lau komepiuta" (malware infecting your computer).  
- Awkward phrasing reduces clarity.  

Correct translation:  
"Manatua o le fa'ašeleina o lau atigipusa e le mafai ona puipuia atoatoa au bitcoins mai le osofaʻiga a le malware i lau komepiuta."
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Peni e fa'amaoniga</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Peni e fa'amaoniga" does not accurately convey "Wallet to be encrypted." In Samoan, "peni" means "pen," and "fa'amaoniga" means "confirmation," which is incorrect in this context.

A better translation for "Wallet to be encrypted" would be:
"Faletusi tupe e tatau ona faʻailogaina" or
"Pusa tupe e faʻailogaina"

Here "Faletusi tupe" or "Pusa tupe" refers to "wallet," and "e tatau ona faʻailogaina" means "to be encrypted."
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>O lau pusa tupe o le a fa'amaonia.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. The English phrase "Your wallet is about to be encrypted." means the wallet will soon be secured with encryption. The Samoan translation given ("O lau pusa tupe o le a fa'amaonia.") means "Your wallet will be verified/approved," which does not convey the concept of encryption.

Correct translation:
O lo'o lata ona fa'apipi'i lau pusa tupe i le faʻamatalaga lelei (encryption).

Alternatively, a more literal translation could be:
O lo'o lata ona faʻamaufaʻailogaina lau pusa tupe.
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Na lē mafai ona fa'amaonia le enisi i le taga 'oloa ona o se mea sese i totonu. E le'i fa'amaonia lau taga 'oloa.</translation>
    
YES
The translation has errors: "fa'amaonia" means "to confirm/verify," which is incorrect for "encryption." Also, "enisi" seems to be an incorrect or misspelled word, and the phrase "le taga 'oloa" is an inaccurate rendering of "wallet." The phrase "Wallet encryption failed" should use the correct Samoan term for encryption and wallet.

Correct translation:
Na le faʻatinoina le faʻailogaina o le taga tupe ona o se mea sese i totonu. E leʻi faʻailogaina lau taga tupe.
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>O le pasese na ulufale i le fa'amaoniga o le 'aofa'iga o tupe sa le sa'o.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is in Samoan, not the language code 'sm' which is Somali. Also, the phrase "fa'amaoniga o le 'aofa'iga o tupe" means "verification of the amount of money," which is incorrect in the Bitcoin wallet context. The original text refers to the passphrase for "wallet decryption," not amount verification.

Correct translation in Samoan (assuming 'sm' refers to Somali, but given the text is Samoan, here is a proper Samoan translation):

O le upu fa'afaigofie na ulufale mo le faʻailoga o le atotupe sa sese.

If 'sm' is intended to be Somali, then:

UNK_LANG, not familiar with the Somali language 'sm'.
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character. If this is successful, please set a new passphrase to avoid this issue in the future.</source>
        <translation>O le passphrase na tuʻuina mo le fa'aleagaga o le 'wallet' e le sa'o. E aofia ai se fa'amaoniga null (o le byte leai). Afai e fa'amaonia le passphrase i se lomiga o lenei polokalama i le numera 25.0, fa'amalie atu e taumafai i le fa'amaoniga o le passphrase i le vaega o le to'atele — ae le o le fa'amaoniga null muamua. Afai e manuia, fa'amalie atu e seti se passphrase fou e aloese ai i lenei fa'afitauli i le lumana'i.</translation>
    
UNK_LANG, not familiar with the Samoan language 'sm'.
```

```
        <source>Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.</source>
        <translation>Na suia ma le manuia le fa'amaoniga o le pusa.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incorrect and unclear. The original English says "Wallet passphrase was successfully changed," referring to the passphrase used to secure a Bitcoin wallet. The current translation translates roughly as "The confirmation of the box was successfully changed," which is inaccurate and confusing.

Correct translation:  
"Na suia ma le manuia le upu fa'alilolilo o le atotupe."
```

```
        <source>Warning: The Caps Lock key is on!</source>

```

```
        <source>Banned Until</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia se'ia o'o i</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Fa'amaonia se'ia o'o i" means "Approved until" or "Confirmed until," which is incorrect for "Banned Until." The correct translation should convey the concept of being blocked or prohibited until a certain time.  

Correct translation:  
"Fa'amaonia faaopoopo se'ia o'o i" is incorrect; a better translation for "Banned Until" in Samoan would be:  
"Taofia se'ia o'o i" or "Nofo'ia se'ia o'o i" (meaning "Banned until").  

Hence, the correct translation is:  
<translation>Taofia se'ia o'o i</translation>
```

```
        <source>Runaway exception</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaoniga leoleo i le alu i fafo</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Fa'amaoniga leoleo i le alu i fafo" is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Runaway exception." The English phrase refers to an exception that occurs unexpectedly and is not caught or controlled in a program, often translating to something like "Fa'aletonu fa'agasologa leai se pulea" in Samoan.

Correct translation:
Fa'aletonu fa'agasologa leai se pulea
```

```
        <source>Internal error</source>
        <translation>Poblemā i totonu</translation>
    
YES  
The word "Poblemā" is a misspelling. The correct Samoan word for "problem" or "error" is "Faafitauli" or "Māfatiaga." Also, "i totonu" correctly means "internal," so the correct phrase for "Internal error" is:  

Correct translation:  
Faafitauli i totonu
```

```
        <source>%1 didn't yet exit safely…</source>
        <translation>E le'i alu %1 i fa'amaoniga i le saogalemu...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate. The English phrase "%1 didn't yet exit safely…" means that the entity denoted by %1 has not yet closed or exited safely. The given Samoan translation "E le'i alu %1 i fa'amaoniga i le saogalemu..." translates roughly to "%1 did not go to confirmation safely...", which misrepresents the meaning and context. Also, the ellipsis in the source uses Unicode ellipsis (…) while the translation uses three periods (...). Prefer to keep the same style for formatting.

Correct translation:  
"E le'i alu %1 i fa'amaoni saogalemu…"
```

```
        <source>Transactions</source>
        <translation>O Galuega Fa'atau</translation>
    
YES
The English word "Transactions" in the context of Bitcoin typically refers to "fa'atauga" or "galuega fa'afaigaluega" in Samoan, meaning "transactions" or "business deals." The provided translation "O Galuega Fa'atau" literally means "Sales Activities" or "Trading Work," which may be misleading or incorrect in a technical Bitcoin context.

Correct translation:
Fa'atauga
```

```
        <source>Browse transaction history</source>
        <translation>Su'esu'e i le tala'aga o fa'amaoniga</translation>

        <source>Network activity disabled.</source>
        <extracomment>A substring of the tooltip.</extracomment>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia o le gaoioiga o le upega.</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Fa'amaonia o le gaoioiga o le upega." means "Confirmation of network activity," which changes the meaning entirely and adds content not in the original. The English source "Network activity disabled." indicates that network activity has been turned off or is inactive.

A correct translation in Samoan should convey that network activity is disabled or turned off. A possible correct translation is:

"Gaoioiga o le upega naʻo" or more naturally, "Ua taofia le gaoioiga o le upega."

Correct translation:
"Ua taofia le gaoioiga o le upega."
```

```

        <translation>O le tagata fa'amaonia o &lt;b&gt;fa'atufugaga&lt;/b&gt;: %1</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect and misleading. "Proxy is enabled" should convey that the proxy setting is active. However, "O le tagata fa'amaonia o fa'atufugaga" translates to something like "The authenticator of fraud" which is erroneous and unrelated.

Correct translation:
Proxy e &lt;b&gt;fa'atagaina&lt;/b&gt;: %1
```

```
        <source>Backup Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Teu Tupe Faleoloa…</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Teu Tupe Faleoloa" is incorrect in this context. "Backup Wallet…" refers to making a backup copy of a Bitcoin wallet, whereas "Teu Tupe Faleoloa" literally means "Store Money Store" or "Keep Money Store," which is not correct. The correct Samoan translation for "Backup Wallet…" would be something like:  

**"Faʻaola se kopi o le Pusa Teuga…"**  

or more simply:  

**"Faʻaola se kopi o le Wallet…"**  

This better conveys the meaning of creating a backup copy of the wallet.

```
        <source>Create Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Faasia le 'Wallet'...</translation>
    
YES
The English source uses an ellipsis character (…) (U+2026), but the translation uses three periods (...). It's better to keep the same ellipsis character for consistency. Also, "Faasia" in Samoan means "to publish" or "to announce," which doesn't match "Create" in the context of creating a wallet. A more accurate Samoan verb for "Create" (in the sense of making or building) might be "Fausia."

Correct translation:
Fausia le 'Wallet'…
```

        <translation>Fa'aali le lisi o so'oga fa'aaoga ma fa'amaoniga o 'address' ma 'labels'</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes English words ("address" and "labels") within Samoan text without clear reason or quotation consistency. Also, "fa'amaoniga" means "confirmation" rather than "labels." A better translation uses correct Samoan terminology and keeps the meaning clear:

Correct translation:  
Faʻaali le lisi o tuatusi ma igoa faʻaogaina mo mauaina
```

```
        <source>Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction</source>
        <translation>Laʻu le Galuega Fa'amaonia Bitcoin i le vaega</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect and awkward in Samoan. "Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction" should convey the idea of loading a Bitcoin transaction that is partially signed. 

A better translation would be:
"Faʻaliliu le Fesoʻotaʻiga Bitcoin na Saini i le Vaega"  
or more naturally:  
"La'uina le Faʻamaumauga Bitcoin na Saini i le Vaega"

Correct translation:
La'uina le Faʻamaumauga Bitcoin na Saini i le Vaega
```

```
        <source>Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction from clipboard</source>

        <source>Open a bitcoin: URI</source>
        <translation>Tuuina se bitcoin: URI</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Tuuina se bitcoin: URI" means "Give/Provide a bitcoin: URI" or "Insert a bitcoin: URI," which does not convey the original instruction "Open a bitcoin: URI." The verb "Open" in Samoan would be more appropriately translated as "Tatala."  

Correct translation:  
Tatala se bitcoin: URI
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>Tapuni le taga o le tagata</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Tapuni le taga o le tagata" literally means "Close the person's bag," which is incorrect in the context of Bitcoin wallet terminology. The correct translation for "Close wallet" in Samoan should focus on the concept of "wallet" (taga tupe or atotupe).

Correct translation:  
Tapuni le atotupe
```

```

        <translation>Toe fa'aleleia se 'oloa mai se fa'amaoniga fa'amaoniga</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because it uses "‘oloa" which means "product" or "item," not "wallet." Additionally, "fa'amaoniga fa'amaoniga" is redundant and awkward for "backup file." A more accurate translation for "wallet" is "tala tupe," and "backup file" can be expressed as "faila fa'amaumauga."

Correct translation:
Toe fa'aleleia se tala tupe mai se faila fa'amaumauga

        <source>Migrate a wallet</source>
        <translation>Maua se 'u'iga o se taga tupe</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is not accurate. "Migrate a wallet" in the context of Bitcoin typically means to transfer or move a digital wallet to another system or format. The given translation "Maua se 'u'iga o se taga tupe" means "Get a feature of a money bag" or similar, which is incorrect and unrelated to migrating or moving a wallet.

A better translation in Samoan for "Migrate a wallet" could be:  
"Faʻaliliu se taga tupe"  
or  
"Faʻamuta se taga tupe" (meaning to transfer or move a wallet)

        <source>Window</source>

YES
The translation contains a leading whitespace before "Fa'afanua", which is a formatting issue. Also, "Fa'afanua" means "map" or "land," which is generally unrelated to the context "Window" in computer or application UI context. The correct Samoan word for "Window" (as in a computer window) is typically "Faasitepu" or can sometimes be left as "Window" in tech contexts, but "Fa'afanua" is not appropriate here.

Correct translation:
<translation>Faasitepu</translation>

        <translation>O le fesuia'iga o Upega i le taimi muamua (%1%)...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "O le fesuia'iga o Upega i le taimi muamua (%1%)..." does not accurately convey "Pre-syncing Headers (%1%)…". The term "fesuia'iga" means "change" or "exchange," and "Upega" means "web" or "network," which is incorrect in this context. Additionally, the English source has an ellipsis character (…) which should ideally be preserved, but the translation uses three dots (...). The phrase should focus on "syncing headers" related to Bitcoin, not "changing networks."

Correct translation:  
"Fa'ata'ita'i le fa'afouina o ulu (%1%)…"  
(This translates closer to "Pre-syncing Headers (%1%)…", where "ulu" means "headers.")

The translation of "Warning" as "Fa'amaoniga" is incorrect. In Samoan, "Fa'amaoniga" means "confirmation" or "validation," not "warning." The correct translation for "Warning" in Samoan is "Faaaogāina mataʻutia" or more commonly simply "Lapataiga."

Correct translation:
Lapataiga: %1
```

```
        <source>Wallet: %1
</source>
        <translation>Pusa Fa'atau: %1
</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Pusa Fa'atau: %1" means "Shopping Box" or "Sales Box" in Samoan, which is incorrect in the context of Bitcoin. The word "Wallet" in this context should translate to "Atotupe" in Samoan, which means "wallet" or "purse."

Correct translation:  
Atotupe: %1
```

```
        <source>Label: %1
</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaoniga: %1
</translation>
    
YES
The English word "Label" in the Bitcoin context usually refers to a user-defined tag or name for an address or transaction, not "Fa'amaoniga" which means "Confirmation" in Samoan. The correct Samoan translation for "Label" in this context would be "Lauga".

Correct translation:
Lauga: %1
```

```
        <source>Incoming transaction</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaoniga o taunu'uga o lo'o sau</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and misleading. The English source "Incoming transaction" refers to a transaction that is arriving or being received, typically in the context of Bitcoin. The provided Samoan translation "Fa'amaoniga o taunu'uga o lo'o sau" means "Confirmation of results that are coming," which is incorrect and adds the notion of "confirmation" and "results," unrelated to the source meaning.

A correct translation in Samoan for "Incoming transaction" would be:
"Felauaiga o lo'o sau" or "Felauaiga ulufale"
```

        <translation>O le fa'avae o ki HD o le &lt;b&gt;fa'atufugaga&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES
The translation incorrectly translates "enabled" as "fa'atufugaga," which means "generation" or "creation," instead of "enabled." The original means "HD key generation is enabled," indicating that the functionality is turned on. The correct Samoan translation for "enabled" is "fa'atagaina" or "fa'agaoioia."

Correct translation:
O le gaosiga o ki HD ua &lt;b&gt;fa'agaoioia&lt;/b&gt;

YES  
The translation misrepresents the meaning of "encrypted" as "fa'amaoniga," which means "verification" or "confirmation" in Samoan, not encryption. The correct term for "encrypted" related to cryptography or data security is closer to "fa'aogaina auala faʻalilolilo" (using a secret method) or simply "fa'alilolilo" (secret/encrypted). Also, there is a slight structural issue, as "o lo'o" should precede both adjectives for clarity and grammaticality in Samoan.

Correct translation:  
O le taga tupe &lt;b&gt;fa'alilolilo&lt;/b&gt; ma o lo'o &lt;b&gt;tapuni&lt;/b&gt; i le taimi nei

The word "uo" in Samoan means "friend," which is incorrect in this context. The correct word for "unit" related to measurement is "vaega." The rest of the translation and format are correct.

Correct translation:

```
        <source>List mode</source>
        <translation>Faʻamau i le lisi</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Faʻamau i le lisi" in Samoan means "Button in the list" or "Press in the list," which does not correctly convey the English phrase "List mode." "List mode" refers to a mode or setting where something is displayed as a list.

A better translation would be:
"Faiga lisi"
```

```
        <source>Copy label</source>
        <translation>Kopi fa'amaonia</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "Copy label" should refer to copying a "label" (i.e., a tag or name). However, "Kopi fa'amaonia" means "Copy certificate" or "Copy verification," which is incorrect in this context.

Correct translation:
Kopi le igoa
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Kopi  amount</translation>
    
YES
The English word "amount" was not translated and remains in English, while "Copy" was translated as "Kopi". This is inconsistent and incorrect for a proper translation. Both words should be translated into Samoan.

Correct translation:
Kopi le aofaʻi
```

```
        <source>Copy transaction ID and output index</source>
        <translation>Kopi i le fa'amaoniga ma le ID ma le lisi o le fa'amaoniga</translation>
    
YES  
The original English is "Copy transaction ID and output index". The translation reads "Kopi i le fa'amaoniga ma le ID ma le lisi o le fa'amaoniga," which translates back roughly as "Copy the confirmation and the ID and the list of the confirmation." This is incorrect and introduces extra terms: "fa'amaoniga" means "confirmation," and "lisi o le fa'amaoniga" means "list of the confirmation," neither of which correspond to "transaction" or "output index." Also, "ID" is kept as "ID," which is fine, but the rest is incorrect.

Correct translation in Samoan would be something like:  
"Kopi le ID o le fefaʻatauaiga ma le numera o le iʻuga"

Explanation:  
- "fefaʻatauaiga" = transaction  
- "numera o le iʻuga" = output index  
- "Kopi" = copy

So the correct translation should be:  
Kopi le ID o le fefaʻatauaiga ma le numera o le iʻuga

The translation contains an unnecessary trailing space after "tau". Also, it should accurately translate the phrase "Copy fee" in the context of Bitcoin transaction fees. The current translation "kopi tau" literally means "copy fee" but the trailing space is incorrect formatting.  

Correct translation:

        <source>(%1 locked)</source>

YES  
The translation "%1 loka" for "( %1 locked)" is not accurate in Samoan. The word "loka" may be understood as "lock" but does not correctly convey the past participle "locked" to indicate status. A more appropriate translation to express something is locked in Samoan would be:  

Correct translation:

Here, "lokaia" is the past participle form used to mean "locked."

YES  
The original English phrase "(no label)" indicates that there is no label assigned. The Samoan translation "(leai se fa'amaoniga)" means "(no confirmation)" rather than "(no label)". The correct translation for "(no label)" in Samoan should be "(leai se igoa)" or "(leai se lipine)" depending on context, but "(leai se igoa)" is more appropriate for "label" in UI contexts.

Correct translation:

The translation "Fausia Tasi Pese" is incorrect for "Create Wallet" in Samoan. "Wallet" should be translated as "Pusa tupe" or "Pusa", not "Tasi Pese" which means "one song". The correct translation is:

"Create wallet warning" should indicate a warning about creating a wallet, but the provided translation "Fausia le aso faʻamaoniga o le 'wallet" literally translates to "Create the day confirmation of the 'wallet", which is incorrect and does not make sense.

YES  
The translation "Si’itia le atotupe" in Samoan means "Lift the wallet" or "Raise the wallet," which does not correspond to the technical sense of "Migrate wallet" (typically implying transferring or moving wallet data). A more accurate translation reflecting the technical action of migrating or transferring would be:

"Folafola le atotupe" (meaning "transfer the wallet") or  
"Fa'aliliu le atotupe" (meaning "migrate/convert the wallet")  

Correct translation:

The translation is problematic because it does not accurately convey the meaning of "Migrating Wallet %1…". The phrase suggests a technical process of transferring or updating a wallet, which should be reflected clearly in the translation. The current translation "Pōtū Vālea o le Fa'asalalau" does not correctly mean "Migrating Wallet". 

A more accurate translation in Samoan for "Migrating Wallet %1…" could be:
"Fa'asalalau le Pōtū Vālea &lt;b&gt;%1&lt;/b&gt;…" 

Here, "Fa'asalalau" means "migrating" or "transferring," and "Pōtū Vālea" corresponds to "Wallet."

YES  
The translation "Toe fa'aleleia le Pusa O le 'Aumauga" is awkward and does not accurately convey "Restore Wallet." The phrase literally means something like "Repair the Box of the Collection," which is not correct for "wallet" or "restore."

A correct Samoan translation for "Restore Wallet" in the Bitcoin context would be:  
"Toe fa'aleleia le Pusa O tupe"  
or more simply:  
"Toe fa'aleleia le Pusa tupe"  

Here, "Pusa tupe" means "wallet" and "Toe fa'aleleia" means "restore" or "repair." Alternatively, as "wallet" is a technical term, it may also be left in English ("wallet") if commonly used in Samoan contexts, but the best precise translation would be:  
"Toe fa'aleleia le Pusa tupe"

Correct translation:

The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of "Encrypt the wallet." The English text refers to encrypting the wallet, but the Samoan translation uses "Fa'amaonia," which means "to confirm" or "to guarantee," not "to encrypt." Also, "a passphrase of your choice" is translated as "se upu fa'amaonia e le'o e filifilia," meaning "a passphrase that is not chosen by you," which is incorrect.

YES
The translation is slightly inaccurate and misleading. The original text says: "The address associated with this address list entry. This can only be modified for sending addresses." The translation incorrectly adds the word "fa'amaoniga" (which means "verification" or "confirmation") and changes the meaning. It should clearly state that the address is associated with the list entry and only modifiable for sending addresses, not involving verification.

Correct translation:

The translation "Fa'amae'a le tu'uina o le adiresi" means "Complete the sending of the address" or "Finish the sending of the address," which is incorrect in this context. The source text "Edit receiving address" refers to modifying the address used to receive Bitcoin, not sending or completing anything.

A correct Samoan translation would be:
"Faʻasaʻoloto nofoaga o le tuuina mai" or more directly,
"Fa'asa'o le tu'uina mai o le tuatusi"

Since "address" is correctly translated as "tuatusi," and "receiving" can be rendered as "tu'uina mai" or "saili" in this context, the most accurate and concise translation would be:

"Fa'asa'o le tu'uina mai o le tuatusi"
```

```
        <source>Edit sending address</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia le tu'uina o le tuatusi</translation>

The translation "Fa'amaonia le tu'uina o le tuatusi" means "Confirm the sending of the address," which is incorrect. The English text "Edit sending address" refers to modifying or changing the address used to send Bitcoin, not confirming it.

A more accurate translation in Samoan would be:  
"Suia le tuatusi auina"

The translation mixes English ("adresi") with Samoan, and the phrase "na tuʻufaʻatasia" ("that was combined") is not appropriate here. It should say "O le tuʻufaʻatasia o le adiresi" or better, simply "O le adiresi na ulufale atu" (the entered address). The translation should also consistently translate "address" as "tuatusi" in Samoan, which is the correct term for address.

The translation is inaccurate. The English word "directory" refers to a folder or directory in a file system, but the translation mistakenly uses "fa'amaoniga," which means "certificate" or "confirmation" in Samoan, not "directory."

The translation in Samoan has an error: "tusia" means "write," which is incorrect in this context ("download and store"). The correct verb for "download" should be reflected properly (e.g., "sii" meaning "download"). Also "block chain" should be localized if appropriate or kept consistent, and "Bitcoin block chain" could be translated as "fale upega o Bitcoin" or left as is for clarity, but "block chain" left untranslated may be acceptable.

The translation contains errors in word choice and meaning. The English sentence says "The wallet will also be stored in this directory," but the Samoan translation uses "oloa" (meaning "goods" or "product") and "kata" (usually "card") incorrectly, and "fa'amaimauina" means "wasted" or "destroyed," which is incorrect in this context. Also, "faila" generally means "file," but the English refers to a "directory" (folder), which is better translated as "fa'asoa" or "fale teu."

Correct translation:  
O le kata tupe o le a fa'amaumauina fo'i i lenei faila.

YES  
The translation is partially in English and partially in Samoan, making it inconsistent and erroneous. The entire sentence should be translated into Samoan. Additionally, the format specifier %1 is kept correctly.

Correct translation:  
"Ia o lenei le taimi muamua ua tatala ai le polokalame, e mafai ona e filifili i fea %1 o le a teuina ai lana faʻamatalaga."

        <source>Use the default data directory</source>
        <translation>Utilize le faila o faʻamaoniga masani</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate. The original phrase "Use the default data directory" refers to using a set directory for data storage, not a "file of typical confirmations" as translated.

A more accurate Samoan translation would be:  
"Faʻaoga le nofoaga e teu ai faʻamatalaga masani"
```

```
        <source>Use a custom data directory:</source>
        <translation>Use le fa'amaoniga fa'atekinolosi o fa'amaoniga:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Use a custom data directory:". The provided translation appears unrelated and translates roughly as "Use the technological confirmation of confirmations:", which is incorrect and confusing. 

Correct translation (in Samoan):  
Fa'aaoga se nofoaga fa'amaumauga faʻapitoa:

YES  
The translation incorrectly renders "transactions" as "fa'amaoniga" which means "confirmation" instead of "fa'ailoga" or "fesa'uaiga". Also, "not-yet-displayed transactions" should be better expressed to reflect "transactions that are not yet displayed" clearly. The phrase "O le taumafaiga e fa'aaoga bitcoins" is somewhat awkward; a more natural phrase is preferred.  

Correct translation:  
O le taumafai e faʻaogaina bitcoins o lo'o a'afia i fesa'uaiga e leʻi faʻaalia o le a le taliaina e le upega.

YES  
The language code 'sm' typically refers to Samoan, and while the translation uses Samoan words, it contains some inaccuracies and awkward phrasing that could cause confusion:

1. "O lo'o fa'amaonia i le taimi nei %1." translates roughly as "%1 is currently being verified." The original English is "%1 is currently syncing." A better Samoan translation for "syncing" in this technical context could be "O lo'o faia le faʻafanuaiga o %1 i le taimi nei" or "O lo'o fa'afeso'ota'i %1 i le taimi nei" (indicating synchronization).

2. "O le a uta o fa'amaoniga ma pa'u mai i tagata e fa'atau" is unclear. "O le a uta o fa'amaoniga" means "will load confirmations," which isn't the same as "download headers." Also "pa'u mai i tagata e fa'atau" means "fall from buyers," which is not correct. It should say something like "O le a la'uina mai ulu ma pa'u mai i uo feso'ota'i" ("headers and blocks from peers").

3. "ma fa'amaonia i latou" means "and verify them" – this is okay.

4. "se'ia o'o i le pito o le 'upega tetele o pa'u." The translation for "tip of the block chain" is too literal and awkward. "Upega" is generally "web" or "net," not commonly used for "blockchain" in Samoan. A better phrase might be "se'ia o'o i le pito maualuga o le filifili poloka" or "se'ia o'o i le pito maualuga o le feso'otaiga poloka" to suggest "tip of the blockchain."

Correct translation:

<O lo'o faia le faʻafanuaiga o %1 i le taimi nei. O le a la'uina mai ulu ma poloka mai uo feso'ota'i, ma fa'amaonia i latou se'ia o'o i le pito maualuga o le feso'otaiga poloka.>

Hence:

YES  
The translation contains inaccurate and awkward phrases that could mislead the reader. It also mistranslates technical terms such as "headers," "blocks," "peers," and "tip of the blockchain."  

Correct translation:  
O lo'o faia le faʻafanuaiga o %1 i le taimi nei. O le a la'uina mai ulu ma poloka mai uo feso'ota'i, ma fa'amaonia i latou se'ia o'o i le pito maualuga o le feso'otaiga poloka.

        <translation>E le iloa. O lo'o fa'atufugaga muamua o Ta'amilosaga (%1, %2%)...</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is mostly correct but contains a slight issue with the term "fa'atufugaga" which means "simulation" or "faking", not "syncing" or "synchronization." Also, "Ta'amilosaga" means "tournaments" or "matches," which is incorrect in this context (blockchain headers). The correct term for "Headers" in the context of Bitcoin blocks should be something like "ulutala" (titles/headers). The term "Pre-syncing" should be conveyed as "Faʻasologa muamua" or "Fa'asinomaga muamua" (pre-synchronizing).

Correct translation:  
E le iloa. Faʻasologa muamua o Ulutala (%1, %2%)…

The translation is incorrect. The English text "Paste address from clipboard" refers to pasting (inserting) the address stored in the clipboard, but the Samoan translation "Fa'amaonia le tu'usa'o mai le clipboard" means "Confirm the direction from the clipboard" or "Approve the direction from the clipboard," which is unrelated and incorrect in this context.

A correct translation would be:

The translation mixes English and Samoan. "Seti" is an English loanword but the more appropriate Samoan term for "Reset" would be "Toe Fa'afo'i". "Filifiliga" means "Options," which is correct.

Correct translation:
Toe Fa'afo'i Filifiliga

```
        <source>Prune block storage to</source>
        <translation>Fa'ama'a  blokē le teuina i le</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a spacing error ("blokē" has an extra space before it), and "Fa'ama'a blokē" is not the correct way to say "Prune block storage to" in Samoan. The phrase "prune" in the context of blockchain storage refers to reducing or trimming data; in Samoan, a clearer expression would be more descriptive. A better translation could be:

Fa'aitiitia le teuina o poloka i le

This literally means "Reduce the storage of blocks to", which fits the context better and removes the spacing issue.

O le mea lea e fa'aleagaina ai le fa'amaoniga o lau tupe.</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains inaccuracies and awkward phrasing that could confuse readers. For example, "fa'amaonia le taofia o le fa'aaogaina" incorrectly translates "disable the spending" as "confirm the stopping of usage," which is incorrect. Also, "fa'amaoniga o le fefa'asoaa'i" for "transaction confirmation" is overly repetitive and unclear. The phrase "O le mea lea e fa'aleagaina ai le fa'amaoniga o lau tupe" incorrectly suggests "damage" to the balance instead of affecting how the balance is computed.

Correct translation:
Afai e te tuli atu le faʻaaogaina o le suiga e le'i faʻamaonia, o le suiga mai se fefaʻatauaʻiga e le mafai ona faʻaaogaina seʻia maua le mafaʻamaonia e tasi. O le mea lea foʻi e aʻafia ai le auala e fuafua ai lau paleni.

YES
The translation "Pe fa'amaonia e fa'aalia i le Pule o le PSBT." is problematic. It is not an accurate or clear translation of "Whether to show PSBT controls." The phrase seems to mean something like "Whether to confirm showing in the PSBT controller," which is incorrect and confusing.

Correct translation:

        <translation>Sainia Fa'ava-o-vale (e.g. fa'ata'ita'iga o le fa'ata'ita'iga o meafa'amaonia)</translation>
    
YES
The translation is wordy and uses "fa'ata'ita'iga o le fa'ata'ita'iga," which means "example of an example," redundantly. The English "e.g." should correspond to a single clear example, such as "faʻataʻitaʻiga," which means "example." Also, "Hardware wallet" should be translated more directly, for instance as "atotupe faʻavaʻa meafaigaluega" or a simplified term understood in context.

Correct translation:
Sainia Fa'ava-o-vale (faʻataʻitaʻiga: atotupe faʻavaʻa meafaigaluega)
```

```
        <source>External signer script path</source>
        <translation>Le ala o le tetele o le tagata fa'amaonia i fafo</translation>
    
YES
The translation incorrectly interprets "signer" as "tagata fa'amaonia" (verifier or validator) and "script path" as a verbose phrase "ala o le tetele", which is unclear and does not reflect the technical meaning of a file path or script path. In the context of Bitcoin, "signer" refers to a component that signs transactions, and "script" refers to code or a file. 

Correct translation:
"Le ala o le faila mo le tagata fa'atagaina i fafo" 

This better conveys "External signer script path" as "The path of the external signer’s script file."

        <source>Window</source>

YES
The translation contains a leading whitespace before "Fa'afanua", which is a formatting issue. Also, "Fa'afanua" means "map" or "land," which is generally unrelated to the context "Window" in computer or application UI context. The correct Samoan word for "Window" (as in a computer window) is typically "Faasitepu" or can sometimes be left as "Window" in tech contexts, but "Fa'afanua" is not appropriate here.

Correct translation:

        <source>User Interface language:</source>

The translation contains a mixture of Samoan ("Fa'avaa o le"), Arabic ("المستخدم"), and Samoan ("Gagana:"), which makes it erroneous and confusing. The correct Samoan translation for "User Interface language:" should be consistent and free from unrelated script or words.

Correct translation:

        <translation>Faʻavae i luga pe faʻaalia pe le faʻaalia le faʻagaioiga o le pulea o koina.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains unnecessary repetition ("pe faʻaalia pe le faʻaalia") which is redundant. Also, the phrase "faʻagaioiga o le pulea o koina" awkwardly tries to render "coin control features" literally but is unclear. A more natural Samoan translation would avoid redundancy and better express the meaning.

Correct translation:  
"Faʻailoa pe faʻaalia filifiliga o le pulea o koina."

YES
The translation contains some space and wording issues that reduce clarity and accuracy. The word "i le netiweke Bitcoin" is awkward; "Bitcoin network" should be expressed more clearly and consistently, such as "faʻamalosi fesoʻotaʻi ma le upega tafaʻilagi Bitcoin". The phrase "i se faʻaogaina SOCKS5 ese" is an incorrect and unclear rendering of "through a separate SOCKS5 proxy". It should be "i se proxy SOCKS5 eseese". "Auaunaga Tor onion" should be "auaunaga Tor onion" or "auʻaunaga Tor Onion" with consistent spacing.

Correct translation:
"Sopọ i le fesoʻotaʻiga Bitcoin e ala i se proxy SOCKS5 eseese mo auaunaga Tor onion."
```

```
        <source>Cancel</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaoniga</translation>

The translation is incorrect. The English word "Cancel" means to abort or stop an action. The given translation "Fa'amaoniga" means "Confirmation" in Samoan, which is not the same.

Correct translation:
Faʻamau poʻo le Faʻailogaina (commonly "Pause" or "Cancel" could be translated as "Taofi" or "Faʻalēaoga")

A more appropriate translation for "Cancel" is:

YES
The translation is inaccurate and misleading. The source means that the current settings will be backed up at the specified location, but the translation uses "O fa'amaoniga o lo'o i ai o le a fa'amaonia i le "%1"", which translates roughly to "The confirmations that exist will be confirmed at '%1'." This does not convey the idea of backing up settings.

        <source>Immature:</source>
        <translation>le le masani:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "le le masani:" is both inaccurate and problematic. The English term "Immature:" in the context of Bitcoin usually refers to a state where mined coins are not yet spendable ("immature" as in "not mature"). The translation "le le masani:" in Samoan roughly means "not usual" or "not normal," which does not properly convey the intended technical meaning. Moreover, the double "le" is awkward and redundant.

A more accurate translation would be:

"Le matutua:" 

Here "matutua" means "mature," so the negation "Le matutua:" effectively means "Immature:" which fits the technical context in Samoan.

Correct translation:
<translation>Le matutua:</translation>
```

```
        <source>Total:</source>
        <translation>Totogi:</translation>
    
YES  
The English word "Total:" in the Bitcoin context refers to the sum or total amount, not "Totogi," which means "payment" or "salary" in Samoan. The correct translation for "Total:" in Samoan should be "Aofaʻi:"  

Correct translation:  
Aofaʻi:

        <source>Spendable:</source>
        <translation>fa'aaogaina:</translation>

The translation "fa'aaogaina:" means "used" or "utilized" in Samoan, which is not an accurate translation for "Spendable:" in the Bitcoin context. "Spendable" refers to funds or amounts that can be spent.

A correct translation would be:
"tāloanumera:" or "mauaina e faʻaalu:" which better convey the meaning of "Spendable:". 

Suggested correction:
<translation>tāloanumera:</translation>

        <source>Copy label</source>
        <translation>Kopi  fa'amaonia</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Copy label" in the context of Bitcoin UI means to copy the text of a label, not to "copy verification" (which is what "fa'amaonia" means). The word "label" should be translated as "fa'ailoga" or "igoa," and "copy" as "Kopi" is correct. There should be no extra space between "Kopi" and the label word.

Correct translation:
Kopi fa'ailoga

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Kopi  amount</translation>

The English word "amount" was not translated and remains in English, while "Copy" was translated as "Kopi". This is inconsistent and incorrect for a proper translation. Both words should be translated into Samoan.

The translation is incorrect. The English word "wallet" refers to a Bitcoin wallet, but the translation "taulaga" means "port" or "harbor" in Samoan, not "wallet." Also, "tatala" means "open," but the correct verb for "unlock" in the context of a wallet should be used.

Correct translation:

The original English phrase "(no label)" indicates that there is no label assigned. The Samoan translation "(leai se fa'amaoniga)" means "(no confirmation)" rather than "(no label)". The correct translation for "(no label)" in Samoan should be "(leai se igoa)" or "(leai se lipine)" depending on context, but "(leai se igoa)" is more appropriate for "label" in UI contexts.
