```
        <source>New</source>
        <translation>Fou</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "New" to "Fou" in Sm symbols is incorrect. "New" translates to "Mali" in Sm.

Mali
```

```
        <source>Delete the currently selected address from the list</source>
        <translation>Sponge le tuatusi o lo'o filifilia i le lisi</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses "Sponge" which is not an appropriate verb for deleting an address. The correct translation should be "Mati".
correct translation: Mati le tuatusi o lo'o filifilia i le lisi
```

```
        <source>Enter address or label to search</source>
        <translation>Tu'uina le atunu'u po'o le ata e su'e ai</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Delete</source>
        <translation>Tape</translation>
    
YES, The word "Tape" is not an accurate translation for "Delete" in the context of Bitcoin user interfaces. It's likely a mistranslation or a misunderstanding of the function. A more appropriate translation would be "Kufuta" or "Futa".
Correct translation: Kufuta
```

```
        <source>Export Address List</source>
        <translation>Lisi o Tuatusi Fa'asalalau</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. "Lisi o Tuatusi Fa'asalalau" translates to "List of Broadcast Addresses", not "Export Address List".

Correct translation: Lisi o Tuatusi Fa'atau Atu
```

```
        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>Sa i ai se mea sese i le taumafai e teu ai le lisi o 'address' i %1. Fa'amalie atu, taumafa'i mai fo'i.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic because the phrase "Fa'amalie atu, taumafa'i mai fo'i" which translates to "Sorry, please try again" is not a direct translation of "Please try again". The word "Sorry" is an addition. The word "address" should also be translated as a Bitcoin wallet address, not kept in English.

NO. There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.
```

```
        <source>Exporting Failed</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia le Fa'atauina</translation>
    
YES, the translation is incorrect and conveys a meaning opposite to the source text. The source text "Exporting Failed" indicates a failure, while the translation "Fa'amaonia le Fa'atauina" means "Confirming the Purchase" or "Authorizing the Purchase".

NO
```

```
        <source>Address</source>
        <translation>Tuatusi</translation>
    
YES. The translation is incorrect. "Tuatusi" means "address" in a general sense, but in the context of Bitcoin, a more specific term is needed.
Correct translation: "Watu"
```

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(leai se fa'amaoniga)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The English source "(no label)" is translated to "(leai se fa'amaoniga)" which means "(no proof)" or "(no confirmation)". This is not an accurate translation. In the context of Bitcoin, "(no label)" typically refers to an unlabelled transaction or address.

The correct translation for "(no label)" in Samoan would be "(leai se fa'ailoga)" or "(e leai se fa'ailoga)".

NO
```

```
        <source>New passphrase</source>
        <translation>Fesili fou</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. "Fesili fou" means "New question". The correct translation for "New passphrase" would be "Fausia fou" or "Faaupuga fou".
Fausia fou
```

```
        <source>This operation needs your wallet passphrase to unlock the wallet.</source>
        <translation>E manaʻomia le fa'amaoniga o lau fa'amaoniga o le pusa i totonu o le taga e fa'asa'o ai le pusa.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The Samoan phrase "E manaʻomia le fa'amaoniga o lau fa'amaoniga o le pusa i totonu o le taga e fa'asa'o ai le pusa" roughly translates to "The confirmation of your confirmation of the box inside the bag is needed to correct the box." This is not a correct translation of the English source text.

Correct translation: "E manaʻomia le faʻaupuga o lau pusa tupe e tatala ai le pusa."
```

```
        <source>Warning: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will &lt;b&gt;LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS&lt;/b&gt;!</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaoniga: Afai e te fa'amaonia lau 'aofa'i ma le leiloa o lau fa'amaoniga, o le a &lt;b&gt;Losi uma au Bitcoinsi&lt;/b&gt;!</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "Fa'amaoniga" for "Warning", which is incorrect. "Fa'aaliga" or "Lapata'iga" would be more appropriate. Also, "aofa'i" for "wallet" is not the standard term. "Taga tupe" or "polopeka" is more common. The term "Fa'amaoniga" is also used for "passphrase".

Correct translation: Lapata'iga: Afai e te fa'amaonia lau taga tupe ma le leiloa o lau fa'amaoniga, o le a &lt;b&gt;Losi uma au Bitcoinsi&lt;/b&gt;!
```

```
        <source>Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?</source>
        <translation>Ua e mautinoa o le fiafia e fa'amaonia lau 'au'aunaga?</translation>
    
YES: The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of the source text. The word "au'aunaga" means "service" or "utility," which is not relevant to encrypting a Bitcoin wallet. The correct translation should involve the word for "wallet" in Samoan.

Correct translation: Ua e mautinoa o le fiafia e fa'amafapopole lau atotupe?
```

```
        <source>Enter the new passphrase for the wallet.&lt;br/&gt;Please use a passphrase of &lt;b&gt;ten or more random characters&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;eight or more words&lt;/b&gt;.</source>
        <translation>Tu'u i totonu le fa'amaoniga fou mo le taga.&lt;br/&gt;Fa'amolemole fa'aaoga se passphrase o &lt;b&gt;Sefulu poʻo le tele o le pisinisi faʻavaomalo&lt;/b&gt;, po o &lt;b&gt;Valo poʻo si'umea upu&lt;/b&gt;.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic because it misinterprets "random characters" and "words" in the context of a passphrase. The Samoan translation "pisinisifaʻavaomalo" means "international business" and "si'umea upu" means "controversial words" or "obscene words". This is completely inappropriate for a security passphrase.

Correct translation:
Tu'u i totonu le fa'amaoniga fou mo le taga.&lt;br/&gt;Fa'amolemole fa'aaoga se passphrase o &lt;b&gt;sefulu pe sili atu fo'i fa'ailoga fa'afuase'i&lt;/b&gt;, po o &lt;b&gt;valo pe sili atu fo'i upu&lt;/b&gt;.
```

```
        <source>Enter the old passphrase and new passphrase for the wallet.</source>
        <translation>Tu'uina le passphrase tuai ma le passphrase fou mo le 'wallet'.</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses a Samoan word for "enter" that is too literal and awkward in this context. A better translation would convey the idea of "providing" or "inputting" the passphrases.

NO. Tu'uina le passphrase tuai ma le passphrase fou mo le 'wallet'.
```

```
        <source>Remember that encrypting your wallet cannot fully protect your bitcoins from being stolen by malware infecting your computer.</source>
        <translation>Manatua o le fa'amaonia o lau atigipusa e le mafai ona puipuia lelei lau bitcoins mai le fa'ama'i o malware o lo'o fa'ama'i i lau komepiuta.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it mistranslates "encrypting" as "fa'amaonia" which means "confirming" or "validating". The correct translation for "encrypting" in this context would be "fa'ailogaina".

NO
```

```
        <source>Wallet to be encrypted</source>
        <translation>Peni e fa'amaoniga</translation>
    
YES: The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of the source text. "Peni e fa'amaoniga" translates to "The pen is a confirmation", which is unrelated to encrypting a wallet.

Correct translation: "Tātāoga e fa'apipiina"
```

```
        <source>Your wallet is about to be encrypted. </source>
        <translation>O lau pusa tupe o le a fa'amaonia.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate. "Fa'amaonia" means "certified" or "verified", not "encrypted". The correct translation should convey the meaning of encryption.

NO
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed due to an internal error. Your wallet was not encrypted.</source>
        <translation>Na lē mafai ona fa'amaonia le enisi i le taga 'oloa ona o se mea sese i totonu. E le'i fa'amaonia lau taga 'oloa.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is problematic because it uses the word "enisi" which translates to "engine" in English, rather than "encryption". This makes the translation nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin wallets. The correct translation should use a word that means "encryption".
Correct translation: "Na lē mafai ona fa'amafufū le taga 'oloa ona o se mea sese i totonu. E le'i fa'amafufū lau taga 'oloa."
```

```
        <source>The supplied passphrases do not match.</source>
        <translation>E le fetaui le fa'amaoniga o upu fa'amaoniga na tu'uina.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning. The word "fa'amaoniga" is repeated unnecessarily, and the sentence structure is awkward. A more accurate translation would be "O upu faʻamaonia na e tuʻuina atu e le fetaui."
```

```
        <source>Wallet unlock failed</source>
        <translation>Leiloa le fa'amaoniga o le taga</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning of "Wallet unlock failed". The provided translation "Leiloa le fa'amaoniga o le taga" translates to "Lost the confirmation of the bag" which is nonsensical in this context.

Correct translation: **O le tataina o le taga ua le manuia**
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption was incorrect.</source>
        <translation>O le pasese na ulufale i le fa'amaoniga o le 'aofa'iga o tupe sa le sa'o.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic because it misinterprets "wallet decryption" as "confirmation of the amount of money" ('aofa'iga o tupe). The original English text clearly states that the passphrase entered for decrypting the wallet was incorrect, not related to the confirmation of money amounts.

Correct translation: O le upu fa'amalo na ulufale mo le tatalaina o le atotupe na sese.
```

```
        <source>The passphrase entered for the wallet decryption is incorrect. It contains a null character (ie - a zero byte). If the passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to — but not including — the first null character. If this is successful, please set a new passphrase to avoid this issue in the future.</source>
        <translation>O le passphrase na tuʻuina mo le fa'aleagaga o le 'wallet' e le sa'o. E aofia ai se fa'amaoniga null (o le byte leai). Afai e fa'amaonia le passphrase i se lomiga o lenei polokalama i le numera 25.0, fa'amalie atu e taumafai i le fa'amaoniga o le passphrase i le vaega o le to'atele — ae le o le fa'amaoniga null muamua. Afai e manuia, fa'amalie atu e seti se passphrase fou e aloese ai i lenei fa'afitauli i le lumana'i.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "fa'amaoniga" (proof/authentication) which is not the correct term for "character" in this context. The sentence structure also becomes awkward.
Correct translation: O le passphrase na tu'uina mo le tatalaina o le 'wallet' e le sa'o. O lo'o iai se fa'ailoga null (o le byte zero). Afai na seti le passphrase i se lomiga o lenei polokalama a'o le'i o'o i le 25.0, fa'amolemole taumafai mai ma na'o fa'ailoga se'ia o'o i — ae le aofia ai — le fa'ailoga null muamua. Afai e manuia lenei mea, fa'amolemole seti se passphrase fou e aloese ai mai lenei fa'afitauli i le lumana'i.
```

```
        <source>Wallet passphrase was successfully changed.</source>
        <translation>Na suia ma le manuia le fa'amaoniga o le pusa.</translation>
    
YES - The translation seems to have misinterpreted "passphrase" as "confirmation" and "wallet" as "box". The correct translation for "Wallet passphrase was successfully changed." into Samoan would be: "Na manuia le suia o le fa'aupuga o le pusa tupe."
```

```
        <source>Warning: The Caps Lock key is on!</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaoniga: O lo'o fa'aaogaina le ki Caps Lock!</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses "Fa'amaoniga" which means "Proof" or "Evidence", instead of "Warning".
Correct translation: Lapata'iga: Ua ki le Caps Lock!
```

```
        <source>Banned Until</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia se'ia o'o i</translation>
    
YES - The translation means "Approved until" which is the opposite of "Banned Until". The correct translation should convey a sense of prohibition or exclusion.
Correct translation: Fa'asa se'ia o'o i
```

```
        <source>Runaway exception</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaoniga leoleo i le alu i fafo</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The Samoan text "Fa'amaoniga leoleo i le alu i fafo" literally translates to "Police confirmation for going out," which has no relation to the English phrase "Runaway exception."

NO
```

```
        <source>Internal error</source>
        <translation>Poblemā i totonu</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The 'sm' language appears to be Samoan, but the translation is not accurate or idiomatic. "Poblemā i totonu" seems to be a mix of Samoan and potentially another language, and doesn't accurately convey "Internal error".

The correct translation for "Internal error" in Samoan would be: "Fa'aletonu i totonu".

NO.
```

```
        <source>%1 didn't yet exit safely…</source>
        <translation>E le'i alu %1 i fa'amaoniga i le saogalemu...</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses "fa'amaoniga" which means "proof" or "evidence" instead of "safely". The correct translation should be "%1 didn't yet exit safely…". The correct translation is "E le'i alu ese %1 mai le faiga saogalemu…".
```

```
        <source>Embedded "%1"</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaopoopo "%1"</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of the source text. "Fa'amaopoopo" in Samoan means "organized" or "arranged". The source text "Embedded "%1"" implies something is placed within something else.

Correct translation: Fa'apipi'i "%1"
```

```
        <source>Transactions</source>
        <translation>O Galuega Fa'atau</translation>
    
YES - The translation is incorrect. "O Galuega Fa'atau" translates to "Buying Operations" or "Sales Operations". The correct translation for "Transactions" in a Bitcoin context is "Fefa'atauaiga".
NO
```

```
        <source>Browse transaction history</source>
        <translation>Su'esu'e i le tala'aga o fa'amaoniga</translation>
    
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Create a new wallet</source>
        <translation>Fau se taga fou</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Create a new wallet". The provided translation "Fau se taga fou" does not appear to be a valid Samoan phrase for this context.

Correct translation: Fausaga se taga fou
```

```
        <source>Wallet:</source>
        <translation>Pusa teu tupe</translation>
    
YES. The translation is nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. The phrase "Pusa teu tupe" does not correspond to any known term related to Bitcoin wallets or finance.

Correct translation: Wallet:
```

```
        <source>Network activity disabled.</source>
        <extracomment>A substring of the tooltip.</extracomment>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia o le gaoioiga o le upega.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. It translates to "Confirm the activity of the network," which does not convey the intended meaning of "Network activity disabled." The correct translation should indicate that network activity has been turned off or stopped.
Correct translation: Ua taofia le fa'agaioiga o le upega.
```

```
        <source>Proxy is &lt;b&gt;enabled&lt;/b&gt;: %1</source>
        <translation>O le tagata fa'amaonia o &lt;b&gt;fa'atufugaga&lt;/b&gt;: %1</translation>
    
YES, The word "fa'atufugaga" means "culture" or "tradition" which is not the correct translation for "enabled". The correct translation for "enabled" in this context is "malosi".

O le tagata fa'amaonia o &lt;b&gt;malosi&lt;/b&gt;: %1
```

```
        <source>Encrypt Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaufa'ailoga o le Teugā Tupe…</translation>
    
YES. The provided translation is grammatically incorrect and doesn't convey the intended meaning of "Encrypt Wallet". The word "Fa'amaufa'ailoga" translates to "encryption" or "encrypting", but the context of "Wallet" is missing. Also, the word order is incorrect for the Samoan language.

Correct translation:
<translation>Fa'apūlosi le Teugatupe…</translation>
```

```
        <source>Encrypt the private keys that belong to your wallet</source>
        <translation>Fa'amau i lalo fa'alilolilo ki tumaoti e iai i lau atotupe</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning of encrypting private keys. The verb "Fa'amau i lalo" means "write down" or "record," which is the opposite of encryption.
Correct translation: "Fa'apalaul Lohia ki tumaoti e iai i lau atotupe"
```

```
        <source>Backup Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Teu Tupe Faleoloa…</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and uses a term that means "bank" instead of "wallet". The correct translation for "Backup Wallet" in Samoan should refer to a wallet used for storing money or cryptocurrencies.

The correct translation is: Teu Puipui Pusa Tupe…
```

```
        <source>Sign message…</source>
        <translation>Saini  feʻau...</translation>
    
YES - The translation has an extra space between "Saini" and "feʻau". The correct translation should be "Saini feʻau...".
```

```
        <source>Sign messages with your Bitcoin addresses to prove you own them</source>
        <translation>Saini feʻau i au tuatusi Bitcoin e fa'amaonia ai o oe e ona</translation>
    
YES - The translation is missing the word "messages". The correct translation should be "Saini fe'au i au tuatusi Bitcoin e fa'amaonia ai o oe e ona"
```

```
        <source>Verify messages to ensure they were signed with specified Bitcoin addresses</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia manatu e fa'amaonia ai na'o le 'alelesi fa'amaonia i tuatusi Bitcoin fa'amaonia</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate and nonsensical. It seems to be a word-for-word translation that doesn't convey the original meaning.
Correct translation: Fa'amaonia savali e mautinoa ai na sainia i koneise Bitcoin ua fa'ailoa atu.
```

```
        <source>Create Wallet…</source>
        <translation>Faasia le 'Wallet'...</translation>
    
YES - The Samoan translation uses the English word 'Wallet' within quotation marks, which is not ideal. A more natural translation would be to use a Samoan term for wallet if one is commonly understood in the context of cryptocurrency. However, without further context on preferred Samoan terminology for "wallet" in this domain, this is a minor issue. A more direct translation of "Create" would be "Fai" or "Fausaga".

Corrected translation: Fausaga le 'Wallet'...
```

```
        <source>Close All Wallets…</source>
        <translation>Tapuni Uma Pusa Fa'atau...</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses the wrong word for "Wallets". The correct word in Samoan for "Wallets" is "tupe" or "pusa tupe". The translation also uses the wrong word for "Close", the correct word in Samoan for "Close" is "Tapuni" or "Pusa". The translation provided is: "Tapuni Uma Pusa Fa'atau..." which translates to "Close All Buy Boxes...".

Correct translation: Tapuni uma pusa tupe...

        <translation>Fa'aali le lisi o so'oga fa'aaoga ma fa'amaoniga o 'address' ma 'labels'</translation>
    
YES - The translation is problematic because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. It seems to directly translate "address" and "labels" as loanwords without proper Samoan equivalents or context.

Correct translation: Fa'aali le lisi o tuatusi ma fa'ailoga na fa'aaogaina
```

```
        <source>Transactions after this will not yet be visible.</source>
        <translation>O gaioiga o le taimi nei o le a le mafai ona faʻaalia.</translation>
    
YES - The translation is not accurate and does not convey the intended meaning of the English source. The word "gaioiga" means "activity" or "action", and "faʻaalia" means "visible" or "displayed". The phrase "o le taimi nei" means "at this time". The literal translation would be "Activities at this time will not be visible." This is not the same as "Transactions after this will not yet be visible."

The correct translation should convey that future transactions will not be visible yet.

Correct translation: "O fefaʻatauaʻiga pe a mavae atu nei o le a le oʻo mai e vaʻaia."
```

```
        <source>Error</source>
        <translation>Sese</translation>
    
YES
The translation of "Error" to "Sese" in 'sm' (which is likely Samoan) is incorrect and doesn't convey the intended meaning. "Sese" in Samoan can mean "wrong" or "incorrect," but in the context of an error message, a more appropriate translation is needed.

Correct translation:
Sese taualuga
```

```
        <source>Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction</source>
        <translation>Laʻu le Galuega Fa'amaonia Bitcoin i le vaega</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and doesn't convey the meaning of the source text. The Samoan phrase "Laʻu le Galuega Fa'amaonia Bitcoin i le vaega" translates to "Load the Bitcoin Verification Work in part". The correct translation should be closer to "Laʻu Faʻamatalaga Bitcoin na Sainiina Vaega" which means "Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction".

YES, Laʻu le Galuega Fa'amaonia Bitcoin i le vaega
Correct translation: Laʻu Faʻamatalaga Bitcoin na Sainiina Vaega
```

```
        <source>Load Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction from clipboard</source>
        <translation>La'uina le Galuega Bitcoin na'o le vaega o lo'o sainia mai le pepa kopi</translation>
    
YES - The translation is not accurate. "Galuega Bitcoin na'o le vaega o lo'o sainia" translates to "Bitcoin work only the signed part", which is not a correct representation of a partially signed Bitcoin transaction. The correct translation should refer to a transaction that is signed in part.

NO
```

```
        <source>Node window</source>
        <translation>Fa'avaa o le 'Node</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The 'sm' translation uses an apostrophe within the word "Node" which is not present in the source text. The correct translation should be "Fa'avaa o le Node".
```

```
        <source>Open node debugging and diagnostic console</source>
        <translation>Tatala le fa'amaonia o le node ma le konsolo su'esu'e ma togafitiga</translation>
    
YES - The translation is inaccurate. "Togafitiga" means treatment, not debugging.

Correct translation: "Tatala le fa'amaonia o le node ma le konsolo su'esu'e"
```

```
        <source>Receiving addresses</source>
        <translation>Tuuina atu i le tuatusi</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and doesn't convey the intended meaning. The word "Receiving" is not translated correctly.
The correct translation should be: "Tuatusi e maua ai".
```

```
        <source>Open a bitcoin: URI</source>
        <translation>Tuuina se bitcoin: URI</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Tuuina" means "to close" in Samoan, whereas the English source "Open" means "to open".
Tuuina se bitcoin: URI
```

```
        <source>Close wallet</source>
        <translation>Tapuni le taga o le tagata</translation>
    
YES, The translation "Tapuni le taga o le tagata" literally means "Close the person's bag". The correct translation for "Close wallet" in the context of Bitcoin is "Tapuni le atotupe".

        <translation>Toe fa'aleleia le 'Upega…</translation>
    
YES - The Samoan translation "Toe fa'aleleia le 'Upega…" means "Restore the Net…" which is not accurate. The correct translation for "Restore Wallet…" would be "Toe fa'aleleia le Upega teu tupe…".
```

YES, The translation is problematic because the Samoan word 'oloa' translates to 'goods' or 'property' and not 'wallet'. The word for wallet in Samoan is 'tusi tupe'. Also, the word 'fa'amaoniga' translates to 'confirmation' or 'proof' and not 'backup file'. The correct translation for 'backup file' is 'faila fa'apolei'.

Correct Translation: Toe fa'aleleia se tusi tupe mai se faila fa'apolei

YES, The translation is problematic. The source text "Wallet Data" refers to data related to a wallet, not a "wallet confirmation" or "account confirmation." The translation uses "Fa'amaoniga" which means "confirmation," and "Pili" which means "account" or "bill," making the overall meaning incorrect and potentially misleading in the context of Bitcoin.

YES. The translation is semantically incorrect in the context of Bitcoin. "Pusa Tasi" translates to "one box" or "single box," which does not accurately convey the meaning of "wallet name."

The correct translation for "Wallet Name" in Samoan, in the context of Bitcoin or any digital wallet, would be:

The translation is incorrect and nonsensical. The Samoan word "Pusa Fa'atau" translates to "Shopping Box" or "Shopping Bag," which is completely unrelated to a Bitcoin wallet.

YES. The translation is not accurate and contains erroneous content. The word "unlocked" is translated as "Faʻaaliga" which means "showing" or "revealing" in Samoan, not unlocked.

A more accurate translation for "unlocked" in this context would be "tatala".

Correct translation: O le taga o le faletupe &lt;b&gt;fa'amaoniga&lt;/b&gt; ma o lo'o &lt;b&gt;tatala&lt;/b&gt;

YES. The translation uses the word "fa'amaoniga" which translates to "authenticated" or "verified" in English. The source text states the wallet is "encrypted", not "authenticated".

Correct translation: O le taga o le faletupe o lo'o &lt;b&gt;fa'ailogaina&lt;/b&gt; ma o lo'o &lt;b&gt;tapunia&lt;/b&gt;

YES - The translation is not accurate and is problematic. The literal translation of "List mode" would be closer to "Faiga o le lisi" or "Tulaga lisi". "Faʻamau i le lisi" translates to "Fixed to the list" or "Attached to the list" which is not the intended meaning.

NO
```

        <source>Copy amount</source>

        <translation>Kopi i le fa'amaoniga ma le ID ma le lisi o le fa'amaoniga</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The word "transaction" is translated twice as "fa'amaoniga", which means "proof" or "confirmation". The correct translation for "transaction ID" would be "ID o le totogiina" and "output index" would be "lisi o le totogiina".

Correct translation: Kopi le ID o le totogiina ma le lisi o le totogiina
```

```
        <source>Lock unspent</source>
        <translation>Kiliki le leai o se fa'aaoga</translation>
    
YES. The translation is problematic because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text in the context of Bitcoin. "Lock unspent" in Bitcoin refers to preventing unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) from being used in future transactions, typically for security or staking purposes. The provided translation "Kiliki le leai o se fa'aaoga" which roughly translates to "Click on the no use" does not capture this meaning.

The correct translation should convey the idea of securing or making unspent outputs unavailable for spending.

Correct translation: **Tapuni le fa'aaogaina** (meaning "close the usage" or "block the spending").
```

```
        <source>Copy fee</source>
        <translation>kopi tau </translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The Samoan word for "fee" is "totogi". The word "tau" means "price" or "cost". The correct translation for "Copy fee" would be "kopi totogi".
kopi totogi
```

```
        <source>Copy after fee</source>
        <translation>Kopi i le maeʻa o le tau</translation>

Kopi i le maeʻa o le totogifuafua
```

```
        <source>Copy change</source>
        <translation>Suiga o kopi</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The word "change" in the context of Bitcoin refers to the returned amount of cryptocurrency after a transaction, not a change in the sense of alteration or modification. The provided translation "Suiga o kopi" would mean "Alteration of copy" or "Change of copy".

A more appropriate translation for "Copy change" in a Bitcoin context would be "Kopi sui" which means "Copy change/returned amount".

NO
```

```
        <source>(%1 locked)</source>

```
        <source>(no label)</source>
        <translation>(leai se fa'amaoniga)</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The English source "(no label)" is translated to "(leai se fa'amaoniga)" which means "(no proof)" or "(no confirmation)". This is not an accurate translation. In the context of Bitcoin, "(no label)" typically refers to an unlabelled transaction or address.

The correct translation for "(no label)" in Samoan would be "(leai se fa'ailoga)" or "(e leai se fa'ailoga)".

NO
```

```
        <source>change from %1 (%2)</source>
        <translation>suia mai i le %1 (%2)</translation>
    
YES - The Samoan translation uses the verb "suia" which means "to change" or "to replace". In the context of Bitcoin, "change" refers to the leftover amount of Bitcoin returned to the sender after a transaction. Therefore, "suia mai i le" which means "changed from" or "replaced from" is not accurate. The correct translation should convey the idea of "change from an amount".

The correct translation is: "suiga mai le %1 (%2)"
```

```
        <source>(change)</source>
        <translation>Suiga</translation>
    
YES. The translation of "(change)" to "Suiga" is incorrect in the context of Bitcoin. "Suiga" in the Samoan language means "to spit" or "spit". In the context of Bitcoin, "change" refers to the leftover amount of Bitcoin returned to the sender after a transaction. The correct translation would be "suiga tupe" or "tupe totoe".

Correct translation: (suiga tupe)

YES: The translation "Fausia Tasi Pese" is incorrect and does not accurately convey the meaning of "Create Wallet" in the context of Bitcoin. "Fausia" means "build" or "construct", "Tasi" means "one" or "single", and "Pese" means "song" or "hymn". This combination of words is nonsensical in this context. A more appropriate translation for "Create Wallet" in Samoan would be "Fausia se atotupe" or "Fausia le atotupe" which translates to "Create a wallet" or "Create the wallet".

YES, The translation is problematic. The translation of "Creating Wallet" to "Fausia Pusa" is incorrect and nonsensical in the context of Bitcoin. "Fausia Pusa" does not translate to anything related to wallet creation in any known language. The correct translation for "Creating Wallet" in a relevant context would be something like "Fa'atupuina le Atotupe" or similar, depending on the specific dialect of Samoan being used, but "Fausia Pusa" is not it.

NO

        <source>Migrate wallet</source>
        <translation>Si’itia le atotupe</translation>
    
YES - The translation is a literal translation of "Migrate wallet". While grammatically correct, it is not the standard term used in Bitcoin contexts for wallet migration. A more appropriate translation would be "Suia le atotupe" which translates to "Change the wallet" or "Update the wallet".

Suia le atotupe

        <translation>E te mautinoa o lo'o manao e su'e le 'u'amea &lt;i&gt;%1&lt;/i&gt;?</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses "su'e" which means "search" instead of "migrate".
The correct translation should be: "E te mautinoa o lo'o manao e fa'aliliu le 'u'amea &lt;i&gt;%1&lt;/i&gt;?"

The migration process will create a backup of the wallet before migrating. This backup file will be named &lt;wallet name&gt;-&lt;timestamp&gt;.legacy.bak and can be found in the directory for this wallet. In the event of an incorrect migration, the backup can be restored with the "Restore Wallet" functionality.</source>

YES: The phrase "A new wallet backup will need to be made." was translated as "O le a manaʻomia se su'esu'ega pusa tupe fou.". "Su'esu'ega" means "investigation" or "examination" in Samoan, whereas the intended meaning is a backup or copy.

Correct translation: O le a manaʻomia ona fai se kopi fa'apolopolo fou mo le pusa tupe.

The translation is not accurate. "Pōtū Vālea" means "empty bottle", which is irrelevant to Bitcoin. The correct translation for "Migrating Wallet" in Samoan would be "Fa'aliliuina o le Pōtō".

YES, The translation is not accurate and uses an awkward phrasing for "Restore Wallet". In Samoan, a more natural translation for "Restore Wallet" in this context would be "Toe Fa'aleleia le Pusa Tupe" or "Toe Fa'aola le Pusa Tupe".

- **Explanation:** The provided translation "Toe fa'aleleia le Pusa O le 'Aumauga" translates more literally to "Restore the Box of the Shipment" which doesn't accurately convey the meaning of restoring a Bitcoin wallet. "Pusa Tupe" (money box/wallet) or "Pusa Oloa" (goods box) are more appropriate terms. "Toe Fa'aleleia" is a correct translation for "Restore", but the subsequent phrase is where the inaccuracy lies.

YES - The translation of "Restoring Wallet" to "Toe Faʻaleleia le ʻApefaʻamau" is incorrect. "ʻApefaʻamau" translates to "wallet" in Samoan, but "Faʻaleleia" means "repair" or "fix," not "restore." A more appropriate translation for "restore" in this context would be "Toe faʻafoʻi mai" or "Toe faʻafoʻi le tulaga."

        <translation>Fa'amolemole tu'uina mai se igoa ma, afai e mana'o i le, fa'amaonia so'o se filifiliga fa'atekinolosi</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses "fa'atekinolosi" which translates to "technology" or "technical", but the English word "advanced" in this context means "sophisticated" or "complex," not "technological." A more appropriate translation for "advanced options" would be "filifiliga fa'apitoa" or "filifiliga fa'aopoopo".

Correct translation: Fa'amolemole tu'uina mai se igoa ma, afai e mana'o i ai, fa'amaonia so'o se filifiliga fa'apitoa

        <source>Wallet</source>
        <translation>peni</translation>
    
YES, the translation is incorrect. The word "peni" in 'sm' (Swahili) means "money". The correct translation for "Wallet" in the context of Bitcoin is "mkoba".

NO

        <translation>Fa'amaonia le taga. O le taga o le a fa'amaonia ma se upu fa'amaonia e le'o e filifilia.</translation>
    
YES: The translation incorrectly translates "Encrypt" as "Fa'amaonia" which means "Confirm" or "Validate". The correct translation for "Encrypt" would be "Fa'ailoga" or "Si'i atu". Additionally, "passphrase of your choice" is translated as "upu fa'amaonia e le'o e filifilia" which translates to "confirmation word not chosen by you", which is also incorrect. A better translation would be "upu fa'amaonia e te filifilia".

Correct translation: Fa'ailoga le taga. O le taga o le a fa'ailoga ma se upu fa'amaonia e te filifilia.

```
        <source>Encrypt Wallet</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia Pusa Upe</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The source text "Encrypt Wallet" implies securing the wallet with a password. The translation "Fa'amaonia Pusa Upe" means "Confirm Wallet" or "Verify Wallet", which does not convey the intended meaning of encryption.

The correct translation should be: Fa'apilo Pusa Upe

YES - The translation incorrectly uses "Fa'ate'a i luga o ki patino" which translates to "Turn on private keys". The source text "Disable private keys" should be translated to "Fa'aleaoga ki patino" or something similar.

Correct translation: Fa'aleaoga ki patino mo lenei atotupe. O atotupe e le mafai ona fa'aogaina ki patino o le a leai ni ki patino ma e le mafai ona i ai se fatu HD po'o ki patino na fa'aulufaleina. O lenei mea e lelei mo atotupe na'o le mata'ituina.

        <translation>Faʻamaonia o Ki Faʻamaonia</translation>
    
YES. The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of the source text. The source text "Disable Private Keys" refers to turning off or deactivating private keys. The provided translation "Faʻamaonia o Ki Faʻamaonia" translates to "Confirm Private Keys", which is a completely different action.

        <source>Make Blank Wallet</source>
        <translation>Fai se 'Apera Tetele</translation>
    
YES. The translation is nonsensical and likely a bad machine translation. The Samoan phrase "Fai se 'Apera Tetele" does not translate to "Make Blank Wallet" in a meaningful way related to Bitcoin. A better translation would be:

<translation>Fai se taga tupe avanoa</translation>

YES - The translation incorrectly translates "wallet preferences" as "fa'amaoniga o pusa tupe" (wallet confirmation) instead of "tulaga fa'apitoa o le pusa tupe" (wallet preferences). The phrase "i le amataga" (at the beginning) is also misplaced.
Correct translation: Fa'aoga se masini fa'amaonia fa'ava-o-uta e pei o se tupe teu hardware. Fa'atonu le tusitusiga a le fa'amaonia fa'ava-o-uta i tulaga fa'apitoa o le pusa tupe i le amataga.

YES. The translation of "Compiled without external signing support (required for external signing)" into Samoan is inaccurate. The Samoan phrase "Na fa'amaonia e le leai o le lagolago o saieniga i fafo (e mana'omia mo le saieniga i fafo)" literally translates to "Confirmed by the lack of external signing support (required for external signing)". This implies that the compilation was *confirmed* to be without support, rather than stating that it *was compiled without* support.

YES
The translation of "address list entry" is incorrect. It translates to "ulutala o le lisi o tuatusi" which means "title of the address list". The correct translation should be "mea o lo'o i totonu o le lisi o tuatusi".
Correct translation: O le fa'amaoniga o lo'o feso'ota'i ma lenei mea o lo'o i totonu o le lisi o tuatusi

YES: The translation misinterprets "sending addresses" as "authorized addresses". The correct translation should reflect that the address can only be modified for addresses used for sending.

        <source>New sending address</source>
        <translation>Tafaʻilagi fou</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The Samoan translation "Tafaʻilagi fou" means "New user" or "New contact", which is not an accurate translation of "New sending address" in the context of Bitcoin. A more appropriate translation would refer to a new address for sending Bitcoin.

Correct translation: Tuʻu meli fou mo le auina atu

```
        <source>Edit receiving address</source>
        <translation>Fa'amae'a le tu'uina o le adiresi</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The word "address" has been translated to "adiresi" which is not a Samoan word. It should be translated to "tuatusi". The phrase "receiving address" refers to a Bitcoin wallet address, which is a type of address that needs to be translated correctly.

NO
```

```
        <source>Edit sending address</source>
        <translation>Fa'amaonia le tu'uina o le tuatusi</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it does not accurately convey the meaning of "Edit sending address". The current translation "Fa'amaonia le tu'uina o le tuatusi" means "Confirm the sending of the address", which is the opposite of editing it.

A more accurate translation would be: "Fa'asa'oloto le tuatusi o le lafoina" or "Suia le tuatusi o le lafoina".

        <translation>O le "adresi" na tuʻufaʻatasia "%1" e le o se adresi Bitcoin talafeagai.</translation>
    
YES. The translation is grammatically incorrect and awkward. The word "adresi" is repeated, and the word order is unnatural.

The correct translation should be: "O le tuatusi na ulufale ai, "%1", e le o se tuatusi Bitcoin talafeagai."
```

```
        <source>Address "%1" already exists as a receiving address with label "%2" and so cannot be added as a sending address.</source>

YES, The translation contains unnecessary quotation marks around the word "Adresu" and the term "adresu" appears twice in the sentence, creating redundancy and awkwardness. The correct translation is: "O le tuatusi "%1" ua iai faatasi ma se tuatusi e taliaina ma le faʻailoga "%2" ma e le mafai ona faʻaopoopoina o se tuatusi e lafo ai."

        <translation>O le adiresi na ulufale mai "%1" o lo'o i le tusi adiresi ma le fa'amaoniga "%2".</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses the Samoan word "fa'amaoniga" which means "proof" or "evidence" instead of "label" or "name" as intended in the context of an address book.

NO.

```
        <source>Could not unlock wallet.</source>
        <translation>E le mafai ona tatala le taulaga.</translation>

        <source>Path already exists, and is not a directory.</source>
        <translation>O le ala o lo'o i ai nei, ma e le o se fa'amaoniga.</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses "fa'amaoniga" which translates to "proof" or "evidence", but the source text "directory" is not correctly translated. In the context of file paths, "directory" should be translated to something like "|+|" or "|+|" or "|+|".

NO.

NO

        <translation>E tusa ma le %1 GB o fa'amaoniga o le a teu i lenei fa'amaoniga.</translation>
    
YES, The word "fa'amaoniga" is repeated and incorrect in the translation. It should mean "data" and "directory" respectively. The correct translation should be "E tusa ma le %1 GB o fa'amaumauga o le a teu i lenei fa'asino".

        <translation>O le %1 o le a tusia ma teuina se kopi o le Bitcoin block chain.</translation>
    
YES - The translation uses the word "tusia" which means "written" or "drawn" instead of "downloaded". The correct word for "download" in Samoan is "download" or "sii mai".

Correct translation: O le %1 o le a download ma teuina se kopi o le Bitcoin block chain.

YES: The translation of "created" is incorrect. The 'sm' word "fa'ata'ita'i" means "to try" or "to test," not "to create." The correct word for "create" in Samoan is "faia."
Sese: E le mafai ona faia le katalogi o fa'amaoniga "%1".

The translation of "Error" to "Sese" in 'sm' (which is likely Samoan) is incorrect and doesn't convey the intended meaning. "Sese" in Samoan can mean "wrong" or "incorrect," but in the context of an error message, a more appropriate translation is needed.

Correct translation:

YES. The word "vadega" is not a Samoan word and likely a typo. It should be "transaksene" (transactions).
A e kiliki i le OK, o le %1 o le a amata ona download ma fa'agasolo i le %4 blockchain atoa (%2 GB) amata mai i muamua o transaksene i %3 i le taimi na fa'avae ai %4.

```
        <source>Use the default data directory</source>

YES, The translation contains a grammatical error and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The phrase "faila o faʻamaoniga" translates to "file of proof," which is not the intended meaning of "data directory."

Correct translation: **Fa'aaoga le fa'amaumauga o fa'amatalaga masani**
```

```
        <source>Use a custom data directory:</source>
        <translation>Use le fa'amaoniga fa'atekinolosi o fa'amaoniga:</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the meaning of the source text. The source text is about using a custom data directory for Bitcoin, while the translation seems to be about using a "technological proof of evidence" which is completely unrelated.
Correct translation: Fa'aaogaina se faila fa'amaumauga fa'apitoa:

YES, The translation uses "fa'amaoniga" which means proof or confirmation, but the source text uses "transactions". The correct translation for transactions is "transaksio" or "gaoioiga".
The correct translation is: O le taumafaiga e fa'aaoga bitcoins e a'afia i le gaoioiga e le'i fa'aalia o le a le taliaina e le upega.

YES: The word "fa'atau" means "buy" or "sell" and is not an appropriate translation for "peers" in the context of a Bitcoin network. "Uo" or "pa'aga" would be more suitable.
Correct Translation: O lo'o fa'amaonia i le taimi nei %1. O le a uta o fa'amaoniga ma pa'u mai i uo, ma fa'amaonia i latou se'ia o'o i le pito o le 'upega tetele o pa'u.

YES, The translation is problematic because it mistranslates "Headers" as "Ta'amilosaga" which means "circuits" or "rounds" in Samoan. The correct translation for "Headers" in the context of Bitcoin would be " Ulu" or " Fa'amatalaga".

The translation is incorrect. The Samoan word "Laʻea" means "to carry" or "to transport" which does not relate to "URI" in the context of Bitcoin.

Correct translation: URI:

YES. The translation is inaccurate and does not convey the intended meaning. The original English text is "Paste address from clipboard", which instructs the user to paste an address. The provided Samoan translation "Fa'amaonia le tu'usa'o mai le clipboard" translates to "Confirm the direct from the clipboard", which is nonsensical in this context.

The correct translation should be something that means "Paste address from clipboard". A more appropriate translation would be:

YES, The translation is not accurate and uses the wrong word for "automatically." "Fa'atekinolosi" means "technologically" or "technical," not "automatically." The word "fa'anatura" or "vave" would be more appropriate.

YES. The translation uses an inappropriate word for "compatible". "Tusi talafeagai" literally translates to "suitable book" or "appropriate book".

NO. Full path to a %1 compatible script (e.g. C:\Downloads\hwi.exe or /Users/you/Downloads/hwi.py). Beware: malware can steal your coins!

YES. The translation is problematic as it uses an incorrect word for "directory". The correct word for directory in Samoan is "fale teu". The translation also uses "fa'atonuga o galuega" for "working directory", which translates to "working settings". A more accurate translation for "working directory" would be "kesi o galuega".

The translation "Toe Seti Filifiliga" is a literal translation of "Reset Options" but doesn't accurately convey the intended meaning in the context of Bitcoin settings. In Samoan, a more appropriate and understandable translation for resetting options would be related to returning to default or initial settings.

YES, The translation for "(0 = auto, &lt;0 = leave that many cores free)" is problematic. The translation of "auto" to "ta'avale" which means "car" and the translation of "leave that many cores free" to "Tu'u i fa'ava'e ia fo'i pusa fa'atekinolosi" which means "Leave on the foundation for technological boxes to return" is nonsensical and inaccurate in the context of Bitcoin and computer cores.

```
        <source>Wallet</source>
        <translation>Pusa teuga</translation>
    
YES, the translation of "Wallet" to "Pusa teuga" is problematic in the context of Bitcoin. "Pusa teuga" is not a standard or recognized term for a Bitcoin wallet in any language I am familiar with. In the context of Bitcoin, a wallet is typically referred to by terms that relate to storing or holding funds.

The correct translation should be a word that signifies a wallet or a place to hold funds. Without specific knowledge of the 'sm' language, I cannot provide a definitive correct translation. However, based on common linguistic patterns for this context, it would likely be a term like "Wallet", "Teuga", or a similar word that conveys the meaning of a purse or a place to store value.

        <source>External Signer (e.g. hardware wallet)</source>
        <translation>Sainia Fa'ava-o-vale (e.g. fa'ata'ita'iga o le fa'ata'ita'iga o meafa'amaonia)</translation>
    
YES. The translation of "External Signer (e.g. hardware wallet)" into Samoan is problematic. The Samoan translation appears to be a literal and somewhat nonsensical translation of the English phrase. It doesn't accurately convey the meaning of an external signer, such as a hardware wallet, in the context of Bitcoin.

"Sainia Fa'ava-o-vale" literally translates to "External/Outer Signer". However, the parenthetical part "(e.g. fa'ata'ita'iga o le fa'ata'ita'iga o meafa'amaonia)" is where the real issue lies. It attempts to translate "e.g. hardware wallet".

*   "fa'ata'ita'iga" means "example" or "model".
*   "o le" is a possessive/definite article.
*   "meafa'amaonia" means "certified", "verified", or "authentication device".

So, the Samoan phrase becomes something like "External Signer (e.g. example of the example of the certified/verified device)". This is redundant and doesn't clearly communicate "hardware wallet". A hardware wallet is a physical device that securely stores private keys.

A more appropriate translation would be:

"Sainia Fafo (fa'ata'ita'iga: meafaigaluega o le taga tupe)"

*   "Sainia Fafo" means "External Signer".
*   "fa'ata'ita'iga" means "example".
*   "meafaigaluega" means "hardware" or "tool".
*   "o le taga tupe" means "of the wallet" or "of the money bag".

While "taga tupe" is a literal translation of "wallet", in the context of cryptocurrencies, it's generally understood. If a more precise term for "hardware wallet" is preferred, it might be "meafaigaluega fa'apitoa mo le teuina o ki" (specialized hardware for storing keys), but this is quite long. For clarity and conciseness, the suggested translation is a good balance.

Correct translation: Sainia Fafo (fa'ata'ita'iga: meafaigaluega o le taga tupe)

YES: The Samoan translation uses "faʻaogaina o le upega tafaʻilagi" which translates to "use of the website". The original English text states "user interface language", which is more accurately translated to "gagana o le tagata faʻaoga" in Samoan. Additionally, "toe faʻaʻavanoa" translates to "re-enable" rather than "restarting". A more accurate translation would be "toe amataina".

YES. The translation uses a literal translation of "transaction hash" as "hash o le pisinisi" which translates to "hash of the business". In the context of Bitcoin, "transaction" should be translated as "transaksio" or "fefa'ataua'iga" instead of "pisinisi".

Correct translation: URLs o le vaega lona tolu (e.g. se su'esu'ega o le poloka) o lo'o foliga mai i le 'transactions' tab o ni mea e mafai ona filifilia i le menu o le kontekiti. %s I le URL e sui i le hash o le transaksio. E vaevaeina URL eseese i le fa'ailoga vae i lalo |."

The provided translation "Lau ulutala o fa'amaoniga fa'ava-o-maua" appears to be in Samoan and roughly translates to "Your headers of fundamental confirmations". This is not related to Bitcoin transaction URLs.

A more accurate translation into Samoan for "Third-party transaction URLs" would be:

YES. The translation of "Compiled without external signing support (required for external signing)" into Samoan is inaccurate. The Samoan phrase "Na fa'amaonia e le leai o le lagolago o saieniga i fafo (e mana'omia mo le saieniga i fafo)" literally translates to "Confirmed by the lack of external signing support (required for external signing)". This implies that the compilation was *confirmed* to be without support, rather than stating that it *was compiled without* support.
