```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>නම්පතේ පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "නම්පතේ පිටපතක්" literally means "a copy of the label," which is grammatically awkward and not commonly used in Sinhala for the command "Copy Label." It is better to use a concise command form. A more accurate and natural translation would be:

"ලේබලය පිටපත් කරන්න"
```

```
        <source>Create Wallet…</source>
        <translation>පසුම්බිය වසන්න…</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "පසුම්බිය වසන්න…" means "Close the backup…" or "Close the rear…" which is incorrect and unrelated to the source text "Create Wallet…". The correct Sinhala translation for "Create Wallet…" in the Bitcoin context would be:

බැග් එක සාදන්න…
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්" literally means "a copy of the address" rather than an imperative or command "Copy address" as in the source. The context implies a command or button label instructing the user to copy the address.

A more accurate translation would simply be the imperative form "ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න" which means "Copy address".

Correct translation:  
ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න
```

```
        <source>Open Wallet</source>
        <extracomment>Title of window indicating the progress of opening of a wallet.</extracomment>
        <translation>පසුම්බිය බලන්න</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "පසුම්බිය බලන්න" means "See backup" or "View backup," which is incorrect for "Open Wallet." The correct translation for "Open Wallet" in Sinhala would be:  
"මූල්‍ය පොත විවෘත කරන්න" or simply "වො letට් විවෘත කරන්න" (using transliteration for wallet).  
A clear and context-appropriate translation:  
"වොලට් විවෘත කරන්න"
```

```
        <source>Form</source>
        <translation>වෙතින්</translation>
    
YES
The translation "වෙතින්" means "from" or "by" in Sinhala, which is incorrect for the source word "Form." The correct Sinhala translation for "Form" (as in a document or shape) would be "පෝරමය" or simply "පෝරමය" (poromaya).

Correct translation:
පෝරමය
```

```
        <source>Form</source>
        <translation>වෙතින්</translation>
    
YES
The translation "වෙතින්" means "from" or "by" in Sinhala, which is incorrect for the source word "Form." The correct Sinhala translation for "Form" (as in a document or shape) would be "පෝරමය" or simply "පෝරමය" (poromaya).

Correct translation:
පෝරමය
```

```
        <source>or</source>
        <translation>හෝ</translation>
    
YES  
The Sinhala translation "හෝ" is incorrect for the English word "or". The correct translation should be "හෝ".  

Correct translation:  
<translation>හෝ</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <extracomment>Context menu action to copy the address of a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්" literally means "a copy of the address" which is a noun phrase rather than an imperative verb phrase. The source text "Copy address" is a command or action, so the translation should be an imperative verb form that instructs the user to copy the address. A more accurate and natural translation in Sinhala would be:  
"ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න"  
which means "Copy the address".
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්" literally means "a copy of the address" rather than an imperative or command "Copy address" as in the source. The context implies a command or button label instructing the user to copy the address.

A more accurate translation would simply be the imperative form "ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න" which means "Copy address".

Correct translation:  
ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න
```

```
        <source>Sign failed</source>
        <translation>ඇතුල් වීමට අසමත්</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "ඇතුල් වීමට අසමත්" means "Failed to log in" or "Unable to enter," which is not accurate for "Sign failed" in the Bitcoin context (signing a message or transaction). A more suitable translation for "Sign failed" in Sinhala would be:

සහිය කිරීමට අසමත්
```

```
        <source>or</source>
        <translation>හෝ</translation>
    
YES  
The Sinhala translation "හෝ" is incorrect for the English word "or". The correct translation should be "හෝ".  

Correct translation:  
<translation>හෝ</translation>
```

```
        <source>kB/s</source>
        <translation>කි.බ./තත්.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation of "kB/s" should represent "kilobytes per second" as a data transfer rate unit. The provided translation "කි.බ./තත්." is incorrect because "තත්." does not correspond to "per second" in Sinhala. The correct abbreviation for "per second" in Sinhala is usually "තත්‍ර" or simply "s" recognized as "seconds." Typically, "kB/s" is kept as is or translated as "කි.බයිට්/තත්." or "කි.බයිට්/ තත්." (with careful spacing).

Correct translation:  
කි.බ./තත්.  → කි.බ./තත්. (incorrect)  
Better: "කි.බයිට්/තත්." or "කි.බ./තත්." if accepted, but "තත්." seems uncommon.

A safe and widely acceptable translation is:  
"කි.බ./තත්." → "කි.බ./තත්." if "තත්." means "second" in Sinhala, but since it doesn't, it should be corrected to:  
"කි.බ./තත්." → "කි.බ./තත්." is not correct, instead use:  
"කි.බ./තත්." → "කි.බ./තත්" → "කි.බ./තත්" is not valid.

Hence the best correction is:  
"කි.බ./තත්." → "කි.බ./ත" or better "කි.බ./තත්‍ර" (where "තත්‍ර" = "second") or "කි.බ./ත" (short for second).  

Final recommendation:  
"කි.බ./තත්." → "කි.බ./තත්" is not standard; better to keep "kB/s" as is, or translate as "කි.බ./තත්‍ර."  

Therefore, the correct translation is:  
කි.බ./තත්‍ර.

If unsure, "kB/s" is normally left untranslated to avoid confusion.  

Hence the advised correction:  
<translation>කි.බ./තත්‍ර.</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්" literally means "a copy of the address" rather than an imperative or command "Copy address" as in the source. The context implies a command or button label instructing the user to copy the address.

A more accurate translation would simply be the imperative form "ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න" which means "Copy address".

Correct translation:  
ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න
```

```
        <source>Copy transaction ID</source>
        <translation>ගනුදෙනු හැඳු. පිටපත්</translation>
    
YES  
The translation truncates the word "හැඳු." which seems to be an incomplete abbreviation for "හැඳුනුම්" (ID). This may confuse users. Also, the phrasing is unnatural and could be clearer by using a complete and proper term.

Correct translation:  
ගනුදෙනු හැඳුනුම්පත පිටපත් කරන්න
```

```
        <source>Error loading %s</source>
        <translation>%s පූරණය වීමේ දෝෂයකි</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has a spacing issue with the word "වීමේ" which should be "වීමේ" (correct genitive case). Also, the sentence structure is somewhat unnatural. A more accurate and natural translation would be:

%s පූරණය කිරීමේ දෝෂයකි
```

```
        <source>Error: Unable to make a backup of your wallet</source>
        <translation>දෝෂය: ඔබගේ පසුම්බිය ප්‍රතිස්ථාපනය කල නොහැකි විය.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate and misleading. The English phrase "Unable to make a backup of your wallet" means failing to create a backup copy, but the Sinhala translation "ඔබගේ පසුම්බිය ප්‍රතිස්ථාපනය කල නොහැකි විය" translates to "Unable to restore your backup," which refers to restoring (recovering) rather than creating a backup.

A correct Sinhala translation for the source would be:  
"දෝෂය: ඔබගේ පසුම්බිය සඳහා ප්‍රතිලාභයක් සකස් කිරීමට නොහැකි විය"  
(or a similar phrase that clearly conveys the inability to create/make a backup)
```

```
        <source>Unknown address type '%s'</source>
        <translation>'%s' නොදන්නා ලිපින වර්ගයකි</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is inaccurate and awkward. The source means "Unknown address type '%s'". The translation "'%s' නොදන්නා ලිපින වර්ගයකි" translates roughly to "'%s' is an unknown letter type," which is not proper and uses an incorrect phrase for "unknown."

A better translation would be:  
"'%s' නොදන්නා ලිපින වර්ගයකි"  
(Remove the extra quote at the start and use "නොදන්නා" instead of "නොදන්නා" which appears to have a dot misplaced or incorrect negation.)  

Also, the apostrophes should match those in the source (single quotes around %s), and no extra quotes are needed inside the Sinhala text. The correct translation:  
'%s' නොදන්නා ලිපින වර්ගයකි
```
