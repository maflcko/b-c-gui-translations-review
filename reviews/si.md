```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනයේ පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it's not an accurate translation of the source text. The source text "Copy Address" means to copy the Bitcoin address. The translation "ලිපිනයේ පිටපතක්" means "a copy of the address". This implies that the system is providing a copy of the address to the user, rather than instructing the user to copy it. The correct translation should be "ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න".
ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>නම්පතේ පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The Sinhala translation seems to be a literal translation of "Copy Label" and doesn't make much sense in the context of Bitcoin or general usage. It translates to "Copy of the label". A more appropriate translation would be something that indicates copying the label or its value.

Correct Translation: ලේබලය පිටපත් කරන්න
```

```
        <source>Wallet encryption failed</source>
        <translation>පසුම්බිය සංකේතනයට අසමත්!</translation>
    
YES - The translation is grammatically incorrect and unnatural. The correct translation should be: "Wallet encryption failed" -> "පසුම්බිය සංකේතනය අසාර්ථක විය"
```

```
        <source>Create Wallet…</source>
        <translation>පසුම්බිය වසන්න…</translation>
    
YES, the translation is erroneous. The source text "Create Wallet…" translates to "පසුම්බිය වසන්න…" which means "Close Wallet…". The translation should be "Create Wallet…" or "Create a wallet…".

Correct translation: පසුම්බියක් සාදන්න…
```

```
        <source>Private key &lt;b&gt;disabled&lt;/b&gt;</source>
        <translation>පෞද්ගලික යතුර &lt;b&gt;අබලයි&lt;/b&gt;</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it contains a Sinhala character "ෟ" which is not a standard Sinhala character and likely an encoding error.

Correct translation: පුද්ගලික යතුර &lt;b&gt;අබලයි&lt;/b&gt;
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it means "A copy of the address" instead of "Copy address". The correct translation should be "ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න".
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න</translation>
```

```
        <source>Open Wallet</source>
        <extracomment>Title of window indicating the progress of opening of a wallet.</extracomment>
        <translation>පසුම්බිය බලන්න</translation>
    
YES
The translation is inaccurate and doesn't convey the intended meaning of "Open Wallet". The provided translation means "See the wallet" or "View the wallet". The correct translation for "Open Wallet" in the context of Bitcoin would be "පසුම්බිය විවෘත කරන්න".

Correct translation: පසුම්බිය විවෘත කරන්න
```

```
        <source>Restore wallet message</source>
        <extracomment>Title of message box which is displayed when the wallet is successfully restored.</extracomment>
        <translation>පසුම්බිය ප්‍රතිස්ථාපනය කිරීමේ පණිවිඩය </translation>
    
YES
The translation contains an extra non-breaking space before the final character.
පසුම්බිය ප්‍රතිස්ථාපනය කිරීමේ පණිවිඩය
```

```
        <source>Form</source>
        <translation>වෙතින්</translation>
    
YES. The provided translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Form" in the context of Bitcoin. "වෙතින්" (vethin) in Sinhala typically means "from" or "by" and is used to indicate origin or agency. In the context of Bitcoin, "Form" likely refers to a form that needs to be filled out or a specific data structure.

A more appropriate translation for "Form" in this context would be "ආකෘතිය" (akr̥uthiya) which means "form" or "format".

Correct translation:
<translation>ආකෘතිය</translation>
```

```
        <source>Form</source>
        <translation>වෙතින්</translation>
    
YES. The provided translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Form" in the context of Bitcoin. "වෙතින්" (vethin) in Sinhala typically means "from" or "by" and is used to indicate origin or agency. In the context of Bitcoin, "Form" likely refers to a form that needs to be filled out or a specific data structure.

A more appropriate translation for "Form" in this context would be "ආකෘතිය" (akr̥uthiya) which means "form" or "format".

Correct translation:
<translation>ආකෘතිය</translation>
```

```
        <source>or</source>
        <translation>හෝ</translation>
    
YES
The provided translation is incorrect. The Sinhala word for "or" is "හෝ" (hō), not "හෝ" (hō).

Correct translation: හෝ
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <extracomment>Context menu action to copy the address of a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES - The translation is not accurate. The correct translation for "Copy address" in the context of Bitcoin would be "ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න" (Lipinaya pitpat karanna). The current translation "ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්" (Lipinayahi pitapatahak) translates to "A copy of the address," which is not an action.
ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it means "A copy of the address" instead of "Copy address". The correct translation should be "ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න".
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න</translation>
```

```
        <source>Sign failed</source>
        <translation>ඇතුල් වීමට අසමත්</translation>
    
YES. The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of "Sign failed" in the context of Bitcoin. "ඇතුල් වීමට අසමත්" translates to "Failed to enter" or "Failed to log in," which is not the correct technical term for a failed signature in a Bitcoin transaction.

The correct translation for "Sign failed" in a Bitcoin context would be closer to:

<translation>සැලයි මේක අසමත්)</translation>
```

```
        <source>or</source>
        <translation>හෝ</translation>
    
YES
The provided translation is incorrect. The Sinhala word for "or" is "හෝ" (hō), not "හෝ" (hō).

Correct translation: හෝ
```

```
        <source>kB/s</source>
        <translation>කි.බ./තත්.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. The source text "kB/s" is a unit of data transfer rate, meaning "kilobytes per second". The translation "කි.බ./තත්." seems to be an attempt to translate "kB" to Sinhala as "කිලෝබයිට්" (kilobyte), but then incorrectly appends "/තත්." which means "/second" in Sinhala. The correct translation of "kB/s" in Sinhala would be "කිලෝබයිට්/තත්පර" or more commonly abbreviated as "කි.බ./තත්පර". However, given the context of Bitcoin and data transfer, a more direct and understandable translation is "කි.බ./තත්.".

Correct Translation: කි.බ./තත්.
```

```
        <source>Transaction ID</source>
        <translation>ගනුදෙනු හැඳු.</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. 'ගනුදෙනු හැඳු.' translates to 'transaction clue.' The correct translation for 'Transaction ID' in Sinhala is 'ගනුදෙනු හැඳුනුම්පත'.
ගනුදෙනු හැඳුනුම්පත
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනයෙහි පිටපතක්</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because it means "A copy of the address" instead of "Copy address". The correct translation should be "ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න".
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>ලිපිනය පිටපත් කරන්න</translation>
```

```
        <source>Copy transaction ID</source>
        <translation>ගනුදෙනු හැඳු. පිටපත්</translation>
    
YES. The translation is grammatically incorrect and doesn't convey the intended meaning. The word "හැඳු" is likely a misspelling of "හැඳුනුම්පත" (identity card) or "හැඳුනුම්" (identity), and "පිටපත්" means "copies" (plural). The correct translation should be "ගනුදෙනු හැඳුනුම්පත පිටපත් කරන්න" (Copy transaction ID).

ගනුදෙනු හැඳුනුම්පත පිටපත් කරන්න
```

```
        <source>Error creating %s</source>
        <translation>%s සෑදීමේ දෝෂයකි</translation>
    
YES. The translation is grammatically incorrect and unnatural in Sinhala. The word "දෝෂයකි" should not be at the end of the sentence and "සෑදීමේ" should be "සෑදීමේ". The corrected translation is "%s සෑදීමේදී දෝෂයක් සිදුවිය".
NO. The translation is grammatically incorrect and unnatural in Sinhala. The word "දෝෂයකි" should not be at the end of the sentence and "සෑදීමේ" should be "සෑදීමේ". The corrected translation is "%s සෑදීමේදී දෝෂයක් සිදුවිය".
```

```
        <source>Error loading %s</source>
        <translation>%s පූරණය වීමේ දෝෂයකි</translation>
    
YES, The translation is inaccurate. The word "පූරණය" means "completion" not "loading". The correct translation should use the Sinhala word for "loading".
The correct translation is: "%s පූරණය වීමේ දෝෂයකි"
```

```
        <source>Error: Unable to make a backup of your wallet</source>
        <translation>දෝෂය: ඔබගේ පසුම්බිය ප්‍රතිස්ථාපනය කල නොහැකි විය.</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses the word "ප්‍රතිස්ථාපනය" which means "restore" or "replacement" in Sinhala. The source text "backup" refers to creating a copy of the wallet for safekeeping, not restoring it.

Correct translation: දෝෂය: ඔබගේ පසුම්බිය උපස්ථ කළ නොහැකි විය.
```

```
        <source>Unknown address type '%s'</source>
        <translation>'%s' නොදන්නා ලිපින වර්ගයකි</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses a Sinhala word "නොදන්නා" which translates to "unknown" but it is used incorrectly in the sentence structure. The word order is also incorrect. A more appropriate translation would be:

' %s ' යනු නොදන්නා ලිපින වර්ගයකි
```
