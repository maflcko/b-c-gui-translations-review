# Translations Review by LLM (✨ experimental)

The review quality depends on the LLM and the language. Currently, a fast LLM without rate limits is used. If you are interested in better quality for a specific language, please file an issue to ask for it to be re-run with a stronger model.

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Avrita Spjaldur</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The word "Copy" in Faroese is "Avrita", which is correct, but "Spjaldur" means "card" or "board", not "label". The correct Faroese term for "label" is "merki". 

Correct translation:
Avrita Merki
```

```
        <source>Bytes:</source>
        <translation>Být:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Být:" is incorrect in Faroese ('fo'). The correct word for "Bytes" in Faroese is "Býtur" (singular "býtur", plural "býtir" or just "býtur" as a unit). The colon and spacing are fine.

Correct translation:
Býtur:
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains a typo. The word "Avrita" should be "Avrita" (correct) but "mongd" is a misspelling of the Faroese word for "amount", which should be "upphædd".

Correct translation:
Avrita upphædd
```

```
        <source>Copy quantity</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES
The word "mongd" is not correct Faroese. The Faroese word for "quantity" is "mengd". Also, the verb "Avrita" (copy) is correct.

Correct translation:
Avrita mongd
```

```
        <source>Copy bytes</source>
        <translation>Avrita být</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The verb "avrita" is not correct in Faroese; the correct verb for "copy" is "afrita". Also, "být" is a Danish/Norwegian word; in Faroese, the correct word for "bytes" is "býtur" (singular) or "býtar" (plural, which fits here).

Correct translation:
Afrita býtar
```

```
        <source>Progress</source>
        <translation>Gongd</translation>
    
YES
"Gongd" is not the correct translation for "Progress" in Faroese ('fo'). The correct translation should be "Framgongd".

Correct translation:
Framgongd
```

```
        <source>Out:</source>
        <translation>Upp:</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect. "Out:" in the context of Bitcoin typically means "Output" (as in transaction output), but "Upp:" in Faroese means "Up:" (as in direction), which is not correct in this context.

Correct translation:
Út:
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <extracomment>Context menu action to copy the address of a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Avrita adressu</translation>
    
YES
There is a minor problem with the translation: "avrita" is the Faroese word for "copy", but "adressu" is a misspelling. The correct Faroese word is "adressu" or "adressu", but the standard Faroese for "address" is "adressu" as an accusative/dative form, but it is more common to use the form "adressu" for object of a verb (copying).

Correct translation:
Avrita adressuna
```

```
        <source>Bytes:</source>
        <translation>Být:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Být:" is incorrect in Faroese ('fo'). The correct word for "Bytes" in Faroese is "Býtur" (singular "býtur", plural "býtir" or just "býtur" as a unit). The colon and spacing are fine.

Correct translation:
Býtur:
```

```
        <source>Copy quantity</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES
The word "mongd" is not correct Faroese. The Faroese word for "quantity" is "mengd". Also, the verb "Avrita" (copy) is correct.

Correct translation:
Avrita mongd
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES
The translation contains a typo. The word "Avrita" should be "Avrita" (correct) but "mongd" is a misspelling of the Faroese word for "amount", which should be "upphædd".

Correct translation:
Avrita upphædd
```

```
        <source>Copy bytes</source>
        <translation>Avrita být</translation>
    
YES
The translation is problematic. The verb "avrita" is not correct in Faroese; the correct verb for "copy" is "afrita". Also, "být" is a Danish/Norwegian word; in Faroese, the correct word for "bytes" is "býtur" (singular) or "býtar" (plural, which fits here).

Correct translation:
Afrita býtar
```

```
        <source>The signature could not be decoded.</source>
        <translation>Undirskriftin er ógildig.</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Undirskriftin er ógildig." means "The signature is invalid.", not "The signature could not be decoded." This is a loss of specific meaning; "ógildig" ("invalid") is not the same as "could not be decoded".

Correct translation:
Undirskriftin kundi ikki avkóðast.
```

```
        <source>The %s developers</source>
        <translation>%smennararnir</translation>
    
YES
There is a spelling and formatting error in the translation. The correct Faroese word for "developers" is "mennaararnir" or "menningarnir" (though the word is rare and "mennarar" is often used). However, "%smennararnir" is incorrect because there should be a space or proper formatting between "%s" and the word, and the suffix should be correct for the Faroese plural definite.

Correct translation:
%s mennararnir
```
