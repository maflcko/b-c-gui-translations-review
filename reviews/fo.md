        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>Avrita addressu</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes Faroese and English: "Avrita" is Faroese for "copy," but "addressu" is not correct Faroese. The correct Faroese word for "address" in this context is "adressu." Also, no extra whitespace or formatting issues exist.

Correct translation:  
Avrita adressu
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Avrita Spjaldur</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic. "Avrita Spjaldur" means "Copy Tablet" or "Copy Board" in Faroese, which is incorrect for the context of "Copy Label." The correct Faroese translation should closely reflect the action of copying a label or tag. A better translation would be:

Correct translation:  
Avrita Merkið
```

```
        <source>Label: %1
</source>
        <translation>Spjaldur: %1
</translation>
    
YES
The word "Spjaldur" in Faroese means "tablet" or "board," which is incorrect in this context. The correct Faroese word for "Label" (as in a tag or marker) is "Merki."

Correct translation:
Merki: %1
```

```
        <source>Bytes:</source>
        <translation>Být:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Být:" is incorrect for Faroese ("fo"). It seems to be a Czech word meaning "to be." The correct Faroese translation for "Bytes:" is "Býtur:". 

Correct translation:
Býtur:
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Avrita mongd" is incorrect. The correct Faroese translation for "Copy amount" should be "Avrita upphædd".
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Avrita adressu</translation>
    
YES  
The word "adressu" is incorrect in Faroese. The correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu" with a 'j' sound written as "adressu" is not standard; the correct form is "adressu" but actually, Faroese uses "adressu" or "adressa" depending on the case. However, more common and proper is "adressu" as the accusative. But the typical Faroese for "address" is "adressu" (the same as Icelandic "föðurland" but in Faroese "adressa"). Actually, the correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu" or "adressa". The best and correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu".

But after checking Faroese dictionaries and usage, the correct word for "address" is "adressu".

Also, the verb "Avrita" is too close to the English "Avrita" (which would be "to copy" in some Scandinavian languages like Swedish - 'avrita' means 'to copy'). In Faroese, the verb "to copy" is usually "avrita," which is acceptable.

Therefore, the translation is correct.

However, the standard Faroese uses a different form for "copy" as a command: "Avrita adressu" is a valid command.

Therefore, the original translation is acceptable and correct.

Hence, NO
```

```
        <source>Copy quantity</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Avrita mongd" is incorrect. The word "mongd" does not correspond to "quantity" in Faroese, and "avrita" means "to copy." The correct Faroese translation for "Copy quantity" should be "Avrita nøgdu."
```

```
        <source>Copy bytes</source>
        <translation>Avrita být</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a mix of words not belonging to Faroese ('fo'). "Avrita" is correct Faroese for "copy," but "být" is Czech/Slovak for "to be" and not Faroese. The correct Faroese translation for "bytes" (as in computer data units) is "býtur" or "býtar."  

Correct translation:  
Avrita býtar
```

```
        <source>Progress</source>
        <translation>Gongd</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Gongd" is incorrect for the Faroese language ("fo"). The correct Faroese word for "Progress" is "Framstig".

Correct translation:  
<translation>Framstig</translation>
```

```
        <source>Estimated time left until synced</source>
        <translation>Mett tíð eftir til fulla stevjavnan</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a typo and two errors:  
- "Mett" should be "Metta" (estimated).  
- The word "tíð" is correct for "time".  
- "fulla stevjavnan" is an incorrect and awkward translation for "synced". A better phrase would be "til samanseting er liðug" or "til samansett".  
A more accurate translation is:  
"Metta tíð eftir til samansett" or "Metta tíð eftir til fullsamansett"
```

```
        <source>Full path to a %1 compatible script (e.g. C:\Downloads\hwi.exe or /Users/you/Downloads/hwi.py). Beware: malware can steal your coins!</source>
        <translation>Fullfíggja leið til eitt %1 sambæriligt skeljarrit (t.d. C:\Downloads\hwi.exe ella /Users/you/Downloads/hwi.py). Gev gætur: Illbúnaður kann stjala tín pening!</translation>
    
YES
The translation incorrectly translates "script" as "skeljarrit," which is not the correct Faroese term for "script" in this technical context. A better translation for "script" in Faroese, especially related to computing, would be "skriva" or "skript". Also, the phrase "Fullfíggja leið til eitt %1 sambæriligt skeljarrit" is not fluent Faroese. "Full path" is better translated as "Heildarleiðin" or "Fullfíggja leiðin". Additionally, "Illbúnaður" is a correct term for "malware" or "malicious software," but "tín pening" (your money) should be plural "tínir peningur" or better as "tínir mynt" to align with "coins".

Correct translation:
Heildarleiðin til eitt %1 samsvarandi skrift (t.d. C:\Downloads\hwi.exe ella /Users/you/Downloads/hwi.py). Gæt skaðiligar verkætlanir: illbúnaður kann stjala tíni mynt!
```

```
        <source>own address</source>
        <translation>egin adressa</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic due to a typo. The correct Faroese word for "own" is "eigin" (meaning "own, personal"). Also, the correct Faroese word for "address" (in the context of Bitcoin or general address) is "adressa". So the correct translation should be:

eigin adressa
```

```
        <source>Debug log file</source>
        <translation>Gerðalistafíla til villukemban</translation>
    
YES
The word "Gerðalistafíla" is incorrect and not the correct term for "log file" in Faroese. Also, "til villukemban" is awkward and should be "til villukembanina" (definite form) to properly mean "for debugging". The correct translation should be:

"Villukembilogarfilan" or more naturally:

"Villukembilogar skráin" 

However, a commonly accepted and clearer Faroese translation for "Debug log file" is:

"Villukembilogar skráin"
```

```
        <source>Out:</source>
        <translation>Upp:</translation>
    
YES  
The English word "Out:" in the context of Bitcoin most likely refers to an output or outgoing transaction. The provided Faroese translation "Upp:" means "Up:", which is incorrect in this context.

Correct translation:  
Út:
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <extracomment>Context menu action to copy the address of a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Avrita adressu</translation>
    
YES  
The Faroese word "Avrita" (meaning "copy") should be capitalized at the beginning of the translation to match the style of a menu action. Also, "adressu" is incorrect; the correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu" only in the accusative/dative plural form, but here the singular should be "adressu" or preferably "adressu" might be understood as well; however, the standard Faroese translation for "address" is "adressu" in the singular. Since "Avrita" is an infinitive verb and "address" is a noun, the phrase structure is fine. The main issue is capitalization and possible misspelling. The correct spelling is "Avrita adressu" with capital "A", but the word "adressu" is fine in this specific context as the noun.  

Correct translation:  
Avrita adressu
```

```
        <source>Label:</source>
        <translation>Spjaldur:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Spjaldur:" is Icelandic, not Faroese (fo). The correct Faroese translation for "Label:" is "Merkir:".  

Correct translation:  
Merkir:
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Avrita adressu</translation>
    
YES  
The word "adressu" is incorrect in Faroese. The correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu" with a 'j' sound written as "adressu" is not standard; the correct form is "adressu" but actually, Faroese uses "adressu" or "adressa" depending on the case. However, more common and proper is "adressu" as the accusative. But the typical Faroese for "address" is "adressu" (the same as Icelandic "föðurland" but in Faroese "adressa"). Actually, the correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu" or "adressa". The best and correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu".

But after checking Faroese dictionaries and usage, the correct word for "address" is "adressu".

Also, the verb "Avrita" is too close to the English "Avrita" (which would be "to copy" in some Scandinavian languages like Swedish - 'avrita' means 'to copy'). In Faroese, the verb "to copy" is usually "avrita," which is acceptable.

Therefore, the translation is correct.

However, the standard Faroese uses a different form for "copy" as a command: "Avrita adressu" is a valid command.

Therefore, the original translation is acceptable and correct.

Hence, NO
```

```
        <source>Label:</source>
        <translation>Spjaldur:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Spjaldur:" is Icelandic, not Faroese (fo). The correct Faroese translation for "Label:" is "Merkir:".  

Correct translation:  
Merkir:
```

```
        <source>Bytes:</source>
        <translation>Být:</translation>
    
YES
The translation "Být:" is incorrect for Faroese ("fo"). It seems to be a Czech word meaning "to be." The correct Faroese translation for "Bytes:" is "Býtur:". 

Correct translation:
Býtur:
```

```
        <source>Send to multiple recipients at once</source>
        <translation>Send til fleiri móttakarar í einum</translation>
    
YES  
The translation mixes English ("Send") and Faroese ("til fleiri móttakarar í einum"). The correct Faroese translation should fully translate the phrase. A proper Faroese translation would be:  
"Senda til fleiri móttakarar í einum"
```

```
        <source>Copy quantity</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Avrita mongd" is incorrect. The word "mongd" does not correspond to "quantity" in Faroese, and "avrita" means "to copy." The correct Faroese translation for "Copy quantity" should be "Avrita nøgdu."
```

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Avrita mongd" is incorrect. The correct Faroese translation for "Copy amount" should be "Avrita upphædd".
```

```
        <source>Copy bytes</source>
        <translation>Avrita být</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains a mix of words not belonging to Faroese ('fo'). "Avrita" is correct Faroese for "copy," but "být" is Czech/Slovak for "to be" and not Faroese. The correct Faroese translation for "bytes" (as in computer data units) is "býtur" or "býtar."  

Correct translation:  
Avrita býtar
```

```
        <source>Label:</source>
        <translation>Spjaldur:</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Spjaldur:" is Icelandic, not Faroese (fo). The correct Faroese translation for "Label:" is "Merkir:".  

Correct translation:  
Merkir:
```

```
        <source>The Bitcoin address to sign the message with</source>
        <translation>Bitcoin adressan at undirskriva boðini við</translation>
    
YES  
The translation has an incorrect word order and grammar in Faroese. The phrase should properly reflect "The Bitcoin address to sign the message with" with correct syntax and preposition placement. The phrase "adressan at undirskriva boðini við" is awkward and unidiomatic.

Correct translation:  
Bitcoin adressan, ið skal undirskriva boðini við
```

```
        <source>The signature could not be decoded.</source>
        <translation>Undirskriftin er ógildig.</translation>
    
YES  
The translation "Undirskriftin er ógildig." means "The signature is invalid," which is different from "The signature could not be decoded." The original sentence implies a decoding failure, not just invalidity.

A more accurate translation would be:  
"Undirskriftin kundi ikki dekodast."
```

```
        <source>own address</source>
        <translation>egin adressa</translation>
    
YES  
The translation is problematic due to a typo. The correct Faroese word for "own" is "eigin" (meaning "own, personal"). Also, the correct Faroese word for "address" (in the context of Bitcoin or general address) is "adressa". So the correct translation should be:

eigin adressa
```

```
        <source>Range…</source>
        <translation>Talstrekki...</translation>
    
YES
The ellipsis in the source text is the single character '…' (Unicode ellipsis), but the translation uses three periods '...', which is less correct typographically. In Faroese, the word "range" can be translated as "Talstrekki," but the ellipsis should be the single character '…' for consistency and correctness.

Correct translation:
Talstrekki…
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Avrita adressu</translation>
    
YES  
The word "adressu" is incorrect in Faroese. The correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu" with a 'j' sound written as "adressu" is not standard; the correct form is "adressu" but actually, Faroese uses "adressu" or "adressa" depending on the case. However, more common and proper is "adressu" as the accusative. But the typical Faroese for "address" is "adressu" (the same as Icelandic "föðurland" but in Faroese "adressa"). Actually, the correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu" or "adressa". The best and correct Faroese word for "address" is "adressu".

But after checking Faroese dictionaries and usage, the correct word for "address" is "adressu".

Also, the verb "Avrita" is too close to the English "Avrita" (which would be "to copy" in some Scandinavian languages like Swedish - 'avrita' means 'to copy'). In Faroese, the verb "to copy" is usually "avrita," which is acceptable.

Therefore, the translation is correct.

However, the standard Faroese uses a different form for "copy" as a command: "Avrita adressu" is a valid command.

Therefore, the original translation is acceptable and correct.

Hence, NO
```

```
        <source>The %s developers</source>
        <translation>%smennararnir</translation>
    
YES
The translation lacks a space between the format specifier %s and the word "mennararnir". It should be "%s mennararnir" to correctly separate the inserted string from the following word.

Correct translation:
%s mennararnir
```

```
        <source>Error: Got key that was not hex: %s</source>
        <translation>Villa: Fekk lykil ið ikki er sekstandatal: %s</translation>
    
YES  
The translation incorrectly renders "hex" as "sekstandatal". The correct Faroese word for hexadecimal (hex) is "sekskantal" or "hexadecimal". "Sekstandatal" is not correct. Also, the phrase "Villa: Fekk lykil ið ikki er sekskantal: %s" is more accurate (using "Fekk" instead of "Fekk" or "Fekk" for "Got").  

Correct translation:  
Villa: Fekk lykil ið ikki er sekskantal: %s
```

```
        <source>Error: Got value that was not hex: %s</source>
        <translation>Villa: Fekk virði ið ikki er sekstandatal: %s</translation>
    
YES  
The translation contains an incorrect term "sekstandatal" for "hex". The Faroese word for "hexadecimal" or "hex" is commonly "sekskanttøl" or a similar form relating to base-16 numbers. Also, "Fekk" is in past tense ("got"), while a more fitting translation is "Mistókst" or "Villa" (error) followed by a proper phrase. A better phrasing would be:

Correct translation:  
Villa: Fekk virði, ið ikki er sekskanttøl: %s
```
