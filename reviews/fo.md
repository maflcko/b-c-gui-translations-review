        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>Avrita addressu</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The word "Avrita" is not a recognized word in the Fula language and does not convey the intended meaning of "Copy".

The correct translation should be:
Copy Address
```

```
        <source>Copy Label</source>
        <translation>Avrita Spjaldur</translation>
    
YES
The provided translation is not accurate for the given context. "Avrita Spjaldur" does not convey the meaning of "Copy Label" in the context of Bitcoin or general user interface terminology.

The correct translation should be:
"Afrita merki"
```

        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>Villa við goyming av adressuskrá til %1. Vinaliga royn aftur.</translation>
    
YES, The translation is not accurate. The word "Villa" is a misspelling of "Villa" (error). The correct translation is "Tað var ein villa í at royna at goyma adressuskrá til %1. Vinaliga royn aftur."
        <source>There was an error trying to save the address list to %1. Please try again.</source>
        <extracomment>An error message. %1 is a stand-in argument for the name of the file we attempted to save to.</extracomment>
        <translation>Tað var ein villa í at royna at goyma adressuskrá til %1. Vinaliga royn aftur.</translation>
```

```
        <source>%1 h</source>
        <translation>%1 t</translation>
    
YES
The translation seems to be incorrect. The 'h' in the source text might represent 'hour', and 't' in the translation does not seem to have a clear meaning in this context. The format specifier %1 is correctly transferred.
Correct translation would depend on the intended meaning of 'h'. If it means 'hours', a possible translation could be '%1 k' if 'k' is the abbreviation for hours in 'fo'. Without more context about the 'fo' language and its common abbreviations, it's difficult to provide a definitive correct translation.

Given the ambiguity of the 'fo' language and the potential incorrectness of the translation, it's safer to flag it as problematic. If 'h' stands for hours, and 'k' stands for hours in 'fo', then the translation should be:
%1 k
```

```
        <source>Up to date</source>
        <translation>Javnsettur</translation>
    
YES - The provided translation "Javnsettur" is not a recognized Faroese word. The correct translation for "Up to date" in Faroese is "Dagført".
YES - Javnsettur is not the correct translation. Dagført is the correct translation.

```
        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES
The translation is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of "Copy amount".
Correct translation: Kopier beløp
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Avrita adressu</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. 'Avrita' is not a recognized word in Faroese. The correct translation for "Copy address" is "Avrita talvboð".
NO, UNK_LANG.
```

```
        <source>Copy quantity</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The 'fo' language is likely a placeholder or invented language, as it does not correspond to any known natural language. Therefore, the translation cannot be evaluated for accuracy.
UNK_LANG
```

```
        <source>Copy bytes</source>
        <translation>Avrita být</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic. The 'fo' language is not standard and the provided translation does not seem to correspond to any recognizable language or meaning related to Bitcoin terminology. It's possible this is a placeholder or an unintended output. Without a clear understanding of the intended language or meaning, a correct translation cannot be provided.

UNK_LANG

```
        <source>Copy change</source>
        <translation>Avrita vekslipening</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. "Avrita vekslipening" does not accurately convey the meaning of "Copy change" in the context of Bitcoin. "Vekslipening" translates to "bill of exchange" or "draft" in English, which is not related to Bitcoin transactions. A more appropriate translation for "Copy change" in this context would be "Avrita qoldiqni" which means "Copy the balance" or "Avrita o'zgartirish" which means "Copy the change".

Avrita qoldiqni
```

```
        <source>Progress</source>
        <translation>Gongd</translation>
    
YES: The translation "Gongd" is not a recognized word in any common language. It seems to be a misspelling or an invented word. The correct translation for "Progress" in a general context would be "Fremskridt" (Danish, often used in technical contexts) or "Framgang" (Norwegian/Swedish, also common in technical contexts). Given the Bitcoin context, a more direct translation of "Progress" to indicate the state of a process would be appropriate. Without further context on the intended meaning of "Progress" in this specific Bitcoin application, it's difficult to give a definitively "correct" translation, but "Fremskridt" or "Framgang" are good general translations.

A more likely translation in a Bitcoin context, if referring to the progress of a transaction or mining, could be "Framgang".

Correct Translation: Fremskridt (Danish) or Framgang (Norwegian/Swedish)
```

```
        <source>Estimated time left until synced</source>
        <translation>Mett tíð eftir til fulla stevjavnan</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic. The Faroese translation is not accurate and does not convey the intended meaning of the English source. It seems to be a literal and incorrect translation.

The correct translation should be: "Metað tíð eftir til at vera synkroniserað".

Here's a breakdown:
*   **"Estimated time left"**: "Mett tíð eftir" is a very literal translation, but "Metað tíð eftir" is more idiomatic for "estimated time remaining".
*   **"until synced"**: "til fulla stevjavnan" translates to "until full convention" or "until full meeting", which is completely incorrect in the context of Bitcoin synchronization. The correct phrase for "until synced" would be "til at vera synkroniserað" (until being synchronized).

NO

        <source>Full path to a %1 compatible script (e.g. C:\Downloads\hwi.exe or /Users/you/Downloads/hwi.py). Beware: malware can steal your coins!</source>

YES. The translation contains a lexical error. "skeljarrit" translates to "shell script", but the source text specifies "script". A more accurate translation would be "rit". Additionally, "samsvarandi" would be a more appropriate translation for "compatible" than "sambæriligt".

Fullfíggja leið til eitt %1 samsvarandi rit (t.d. C:\Downloads\hwi.exe ella /Users/you/Downloads/hwi.py). Gev gætur: Illbúnaður kann stjala tín pening!

```
        <source>own address</source>
        <translation>egin adressa</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because "egin adressa" is not a correct or meaningful translation of "own address" in the context of Bitcoin.

The correct translation should be something that conveys ownership of a Bitcoin address.

Correct translation: "eige adresse"

        <source>Debug log file</source>
        <translation>Gerðalistafíla til villukemban</translation>
    
YES, the translation contains erroneous content. The word "gerðalistafíla" seems to be a mistranslation or a made-up word. A more accurate translation for "Debug log file" would be "Villuleitarskrárskrá".

NO
```

```
        <source>Out:</source>
        <translation>Upp:</translation>
    
YES. The translation is incorrect. The English word "Out" in the context of Bitcoin transactions typically refers to an outgoing transaction or an output. The provided translation "Upp" is Swedish for "Up" and is not a correct translation in this context.

Correct translation: Ut

        <source>Copy address</source>
        <extracomment>Context menu action to copy the address of a peer.</extracomment>
        <translation>Avrita adressu</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses a made-up word "Avrita". The correct translation for "Copy address" in this context (Bitcoin) is "Kopi adresi".
NO
```

```
        <source>Label:</source>
        <translation>Spjaldur:</translation>
    
YES, The Faroese word for "Label" is "Merki". The provided translation "Spjaldur" means "Poster" or "Billboard" in Faroese.
NO
```

```
        <source>Copy address</source>
        <translation>Avrita adressu</translation>
    
YES, The translation is incorrect. 'Avrita' is not a recognized word in Faroese. The correct translation for "Copy address" is "Avrita talvboð".
NO, UNK_LANG.

```
        <source>Label:</source>
        <translation>Spjaldur:</translation>
    
YES, The Faroese word for "Label" is "Merki". The provided translation "Spjaldur" means "Poster" or "Billboard" in Faroese.
NO
```

```
        <source>Copy Address</source>
        <translation>Avrita adressu</translation>
    
YES: The translation "Avrita adressu" is not a standard or recognizable phrase in any common language. The word "Avrita" does not correspond to "Copy" in any known language. The correct translation for "Copy Address" in a Bitcoin context would be a common phrasing for "copying an address". Assuming "fo" is meant to be Portuguese, a correct translation would be "Copiar Endereço".

The correct translation is: Copiar Endereço
```

```
        <source>Bytes:</source>

```

```
        <source>Send to multiple recipients at once</source>
        <translation>Send til fleiri móttakarar í einum</translation>
    
YES - The translation is missing the word "einnig" (also) and the word "senn" (at once). The correct translation would be: "Send til fleiri móttakarar á sama tíma."
```

```
        <source>Copy quantity</source>

        <source>Copy bytes</source>

YES, The translation is problematic. The 'fo' language is not standard and the provided translation does not seem to correspond to any recognizable language or meaning related to Bitcoin terminology.

YES, The translation is incorrect. "Avrita vekslipening" does not accurately convey the meaning of "Copy change" in the context of Bitcoin. "Vekslipening" translates to "bill of exchange" or "draft" in English, which is not related to Bitcoin transactions.

```
        <source>The Bitcoin address to sign the message with</source>
        <translation>Bitcoin adressan at undirskriva boðini við</translation>
    
YES: The translation uses an incorrect word for "address". The correct Faroese word for "address" in this context is "vegur" or "tilskil".

Correct translation: Bitcoin vegnum at undirskriva boðini við
```

```
        <source>The signature could not be decoded.</source>
        <translation>Undirskriftin er ógildig.</translation>
    
YES. The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original English text. The original text states that the signature could not be decoded, which implies a technical error or invalid format. The provided translation, "Undirskriftin er ógildig," translates to "The signature is invalid," which is a possible consequence of decoding failure but not a direct translation of the cause.

The correct translation should reflect the inability to decode the signature.

Correct translation: Undirskriftin gat ekki verið afkóðuð.
```

```
        <source>own address</source>
        <translation>egin adressa</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because "egin adressa" is not a correct or meaningful translation of "own address" in the context of Bitcoin.

The correct translation should be something that conveys ownership of a Bitcoin address.

Correct translation: "eige adresse"

        <source>The %s developers</source>
        <translation>%smennararnir</translation>
    
YES, the translation is problematic because it is missing the word "the" and the correct translation of "developers" from English to Faroese is "útgevarar".
The correct translation should be: "Hesar %s mennirnir"
```

```
        <source>Error reading from database, shutting down.</source>
        <translation>Villa við innlesan av dátugrunni. Letur aftur.</translation>
    
YES, The Faroese translation is not accurate. "Letur aftur" means "closes" or "lets back", which is not the correct term for "shutting down". The correct translation for "shutting down" in this context would be "slítur saman" or "leggur niður".

NO
```

```
        <source>Error: Got key that was not hex: %s</source>
        <translation>Villa: Fekk lykil ið ikki er sekstandatal: %s</translation>
    
YES, The translation is problematic because the word "Villa" means "house" in Faroese, not "error". The correct translation for "error" is "Villa". Additionally, "sekstandatal" is not a recognized Faroese word. The correct word for "hex" is "heksadesimal".

Correct Translation: Villa: Fekk lykil, ið ikki er heksadesimalur: %s
```

```
        <source>Error: Got value that was not hex: %s</source>
        <translation>Villa: Fekk virði ið ikki er sekstandatal: %s</translation>
    
YES, The translation uses the word "sekstandatal" which is likely a mistranslation of "hexadecimal". The correct Faroese word for hexadecimal is "heksadesimalur". Additionally, "fekk virði ið ikki er" is a bit awkward. A more natural phrasing would be "fekk ikki gilt virði í heksadesimalum".

YES, Villa: Fekk ikki gilt virði í heksadesimalum: %s
```

        <translation>Lurtingin eftir inngangandi sambondum miseydnaðist (lurtingin gav villuna %s)</translation>
    
YES. The translation uses a made-up word "Lurtingin" which is not a recognized Icelandic word. The correct word for "listening" in Icelandic is "hlusta" or "hlusta á".

The correct translation should be:
"Hlustað eftir inngengum tengingum mistókst (hlusta skilaði villu %s)"
```
