        <translation>&amp;Undirrita  boð</translation>
    
ERR
There is an extra space between "Undirrita" and "boð", resulting in "Undirrita  boð" instead of "Undirrita boð". There should be only one space.

Correct translation:
&amp;Undirrita boð
```

        <source>Bytes:</source>
        <translation>Být:</translation>
    
ERR
The translation "Být:" is incorrect in Faroese ('fo'). The correct word for "Bytes" in Faroese is "Býtur" (singular "býtur", plural "býtir" or just "býtur" as a unit). The colon and spacing are fine.

Correct translation:
Býtur:

        <source>Copy amount</source>
        <translation>Avrita mongd</translation>
    
ERR
The translation contains a typo. The word "Avrita" should be "Avrita" (correct) but "mongd" is a misspelling of the Faroese word for "amount", which should be "upphædd".

Correct translation:
Avrita upphædd
```

The word "mongd" is not correct Faroese. The Faroese word for "quantity" is "mengd". Also, the verb "Avrita" (copy) is correct.

Correct translation:
Avrita mongd
```

        <source>Copy bytes</source>
        <translation>Avrita být</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is problematic. The verb "avrita" is not correct in Faroese; the correct verb for "copy" is "afrita". Also, "být" is a Danish/Norwegian word; in Faroese, the correct word for "bytes" is "býtur" (singular) or "býtar" (plural, which fits here).

Correct translation:
Afrita býtar
```

"Gongd" is not the correct translation for "Progress" in Faroese ('fo'). The correct translation should be "Framgongd".

Correct translation:
Framgongd

        <source>Out:</source>
        <translation>Upp:</translation>
    
ERR
The translation is incorrect. "Out:" in the context of Bitcoin typically means "Output" (as in transaction output), but "Upp:" in Faroese means "Up:" (as in direction), which is not correct in this context.

Correct translation:
Út:

        <source>Copy &amp;Address</source>
        <translation>Avrita &amp;adressu</translation>
    
ERR
The translation uses "adressu," which is not correct in Faroese. The correct Faroese word for address is "adressu" or "adressu," but "avrita" appears correct for "copy." However, "&amp;" should be maintained only once, and the spacing/formatting is correct. The main issue is the word "adressu"; in Faroese, it's usually "adressu" or "adressa," but "adressu" is plausible as a dative. Double-check needed, but in most interfaces, "Kopiera &adressu" or "Avrita &adressu" is used.

Correct translation:
Avrita &adressu

If "adressu" as the object is acceptable and standard in FO UI, then the translation may be acceptable, but sometimes "adressa" is preferred. Thus, it's a minor error in formality/case:

Correct translation:
Avrita &adressa

If "adressu" is actually a valid Faroese object form, then "NO" would be acceptable. But based on most translation info, "adressa" is preferred.

ERR
The translation "Undirskriftin er ógildig." means "The signature is invalid.", not "The signature could not be decoded." This is a loss of specific meaning; "ógildig" ("invalid") is not the same as "could not be decoded".

Correct translation:
Undirskriftin kundi ikki avkóðast.

        <source>The %s developers</source>
        <translation>%smennararnir</translation>
    
ERR
There is a spelling and formatting error in the translation. The correct Faroese word for "developers" is "mennaararnir" or "menningarnir" (though the word is rare and "mennarar" is often used). However, "%smennararnir" is incorrect because there should be a space or proper formatting between "%s" and the word, and the suffix should be correct for the Faroese plural definite.

Correct translation:
%s mennararnir
```
